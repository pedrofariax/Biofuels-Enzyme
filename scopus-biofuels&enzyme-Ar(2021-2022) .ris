AB  - Glucose oxidase (GOD) from local isolated Aspergillus niger IPBCC.08.610 shows a widespread application, specifically as a bioanode in glucose-based biofuel cells. Enzymes with adequate thermal stability are necessary for enhancing product efficiency. Also, evaluating the structural dynamics to improve temperature helps to determine the residue. The molecular dynamics simulation of GOD_IPBCC_1CF3 at temperatures of 300, 400, and 500 K was carried out to analyze important amino acid residues for thermal stability. The results showed that the amino acid residues responsible for thermal stability were dispersed into several essential regions, including D576 at the C terminal, E266-R250, and E38-R237 in the FAD-binding domain E485-R470 in the substrate-binding antiparallel beta system. However, the FAD molecular flexibility against temperature depends on conserve E48 by stabilizing the ribose sugar moiety. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Enhanced ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in the atmosphere and increased salinity of soils and water adversely affect photoautotrophs' productivity. Several researchers have focussed on the use of non-arable or brackish environments for growing strains suitable for the production of value-added products along with biofuels. In this regard, cyanobacteria serve as good model organisms as they can survive and sustain themselves in habitats characterized by high UV influx and changing salinities. Thus, these photoautotrophs can help understand the complex physiological processes and adaptations occurring in higher plants growing in stressed environments of salinity and UVR. In the present investigation, cumulative effects of salinity (NaCl: 50, 100, and 200 mM), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and UVR have been studied in terms of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, total protein content, phycobiliproteins profile, and induction of scytoneminin in the two cyanobacteria isolated from different habitats. Production of ROS increased after PAR+UV-A+UV-B, PAR+UV-A, and PAR exposure, and maximum generation occurred in the samples treated with 200 mM NaCl. Total protein content and phycobiliproteins profile was severely affected by these stresses. The maximum induction of scytonemin occurred in the cultures with 200 mM of NaCl and PAR+UV-A+UV-B exposure for 72 h. Our results indicate that Scytonema sp. could serve as a potential candidate for bioremediation of saline soils along with the production of value-added metabolite scytonemin. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are a promising green power source due to their merits of using renewable bio-fuels, environmentally friendly bio-catalysts and mild operating condition. For the practical point of view, it is necessary to tune the power output of the cell according to the electric device of interest. However, current approaches that are based on pH- or temperature-sensitive materials and enzymes in anode or the alteration of conductivity in the cathode face several challenges. In this article we designed a novel photo-switch based on the photo-oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the cathode catalyzed by C-dots nanozymes. As the first photo-switch adopting a cathode-controlled strategy, it achieved rapid, sensitive, and repeatable regulation of EBFC current and the power density with the designed working mechanism. After systematically optimizing the concentration of C-dots and TMB as well as the current collector area, the current of the EBFC equipped with the photo-switch rose from 2.3 to approximately 9 μA and the power density increased from 2.8 to 35 μW cm−2 after the 20 min of blue light irradiation, which is an improvement over most reported switches. Thus, this photo-switch makes it possible to adjust the power output of the EBFCs according to the specific photo signal and promotes “smart” EBFC applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgal biomass has been proved to be a sustainable source for biofuels including bio-oil, biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, etc. One of the collateral benefits of integrating the use of microalgal technologies in the industry is microalgae's ability to capture carbon dioxide during the application and biomass production process and consequently reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Although microalgae are a feasible source of biofuel, industrial microalgae applications face energy and cost challenges. To overcome these challenges, researchers have been interested in applying the bio-refinery approach to extract the important components encapsulated in microalgae. This review discusses the key steps of microalgae-based biorefinery including cultivation and harvesting, cell disruption, biofuel and value-added compound extraction along with the detailed technologies associated with each step of biorefinery. This review found that suitable microalgae species are selected based on their carbohydrate, lipid and protein contents and selecting the suitable species are crucial for high-quality biofuel and value-added products production. Microalgae species contain carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in the range of 8% to 69.7%, 5% to 74% and 7% to 65% respectively which proved their ability to be used as a source of value-added commodities in multiple industries including agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, culinary, and cosmetics. This review suggests that lipid and value-added products from microalgae can be made more economically viable by integrating upstream and downstream processes. Therefore, a systematically integrated genome sequencing and process-scale engineering approach for improving the extraction of lipids and co-products is critical in the development of future microalgal biorefineries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gentle Remediation Options (GRO) are remediation measures involving plants, fungi, bacteria, and soil amendments that can be applied to manage risks at contaminated sites. Several studies and decision-support tools promote the wider range of benefits provided by GRO, but there is still skepticism regarding GRO implementation. Key issues that need to be better communicated are the various risk mitigation mechanisms, the required risk reduction for an envisioned land use, and the time perspective associated with the risk mitigation mechanisms. To increase the viability and acceptance of GRO, the phytomanagement approach implies the combination of GRO with beneficial green land use, gradually reducing risks and restoring ecosystem services. To strengthen the decision basis for GRO implementation in practice, this paper proposes a framework for risk management and communication of GRO applications to support phytomanagement strategies at contaminated sites. The mapping of the risk mitigation mechanisms is done by an extensive literature review and the Swedish national soil guideline value model is used to derive the most relevant human health exposure pathways and ecological risks for generic green land use scenarios. Results indicate that most of the expected risk mitigation mechanisms are supported by literature, but that knowledge gaps still exist. The framework is demonstrated to support the identification of GRO options for the case study site given two envisioned land uses: biofuel park and allotment garden. A more easily understandable risk management framework, as proposed here, is expected to act as a communication tool to educate decision-makers, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders for better understanding of risk mitigation mechanisms and preliminary timeframes of various GRO, particularly in the early stages of a brownfield redevelopment project. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - A massive quantity of organic waste is generated globally. Despite its detrimental impacts on all environmental media (soil, water, and air), a sustainable valorization platform for organic waste has not been fully developed. In an effort to reduce the technical gap, this study placed great emphasis on a new valorization route employing the conversion of food/agricultural waste to biodiesel (BD). In this study, the yellow mealworm larvae (MW) were grown on piles of wheat bran to convert carbohydrates to fat through its fast metabolism. The ultimate aim was to enhance the economic viability of BD by producing fat from food/agricultural waste. Fat from MW larvae were then converted to BD through the non-catalytic conversion (authors-invented) process. As a reference, conventional acid/base-catalyzed transesterification of fat from MW larvae was also made. The conventional conversion process revealed a BD yield of 48.55 wt%, which was attributed to the high content of moisture and impurities in the MW extract. The non-catalytic conversion process of MW extract showed a BD yield of 87.75 wt% in 1 min at 370 °C, showing an extraordinarily high tolerance against water and impurities. The non-catalytic reaction also allowed the in-situ conversion of fat in MW to BD even at 320 °C without fat extraction. The enhanced reaction kinetics could be due to the catalytic effects of the alkaline earth metals in MW. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental sustainability requirements and rising energy demands, as well as the depletion of conventional energy resources and environmental deterioration as a result of abrupt climate change, have redirected scientists' focus. For sustainable development, look for renewable sources of green and clean energy. Bioenergy is a great alternative because it may be used to meet a variety of energy needs with the right conversion technology. This overview covers all aspects of biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, and butanol) and the criteria for their long-term viability. The focus is on the most recent breakthroughs in biofuel production, emphasizing the role of nanotechnology. In addition, a slew of studies is being conducted on developing strategies for process optimization, such as integration methodologies, less energy-intensive distillation processes, and microbe bioengineering talked about. This can assist in making biofuel production in a real-world market more economically and environmentally viable. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuel cells are an interesting way of microenergy production that can be advantageously channeled for biosensing applications. In this study, a biofuel cell was developed and applied as a self-powered biosensor for glucose detection. Glucose oxidase was initially tested for the bioanode and, since no evidence of direct electron transfer was observed in the absence of the co-substrate, it was not further considered. The enzymes Pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQGDH) and Bilirubin oxidase (BOx) were immobilized on Pencil graphite electrodes (PGE), previously nanostructured with MWCNT, serving as bioanode and biocathode, respectively. The bifunctional crosslinker 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBSE) was used as a simple but efficient tethering agent, enabling the establishment of direct electron transfer events. Cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry, and amperometry were employed for individual characterization of bioanode and biocathode as biosensors for the respective enzymatic substrates. A mean sensitivity of 77.7 ± 5.9 μA cm−2 mM−1 was obtained for glucose with a Limit of detection (LOD) of 4.0 ± 2.2 μM, whereas in the detection of O2, the sensitivity and LOD achieved were 336 ± 22 μA cm−2 mM−1 and 3.2 ± 1.0 μM, respectively. Finally, the PQQGDH bioanode and BOx biocathode were conjugated into a biofuel cell and further characterized as a self-powered biosensor for glucose, exhibiting a linear range up to 1 mM, an excellent sensitivity of 8.08 μW cm−2 mM−1, a low LOD of 0.084 mM and long stability (94% of the original response after 12 days). Therefore, PGE transducers and PBSE are valuable strategies for the design of simple and efficient self-powered biosensors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, spent mushroom substrate (SMS) obtained from Ganoderma lucidum used as a potential biomass for bioethanol production was investigated. Sulphuric acid pretreatment of SMS was evaluated to optimize the sugar extraction through hydrolysis. The proximate composition of SMS was analysed. Total sugar and reducing sugar yield from SMS were calculated as 33.58 ± 0.17 mg/g and 8.28 ± 0.35 mg/g DW, respectively. Total organic carbon was recorded as 17.74 % DW. SMS pretreated with 1 % sulphuric acid yielded maximum total sugar of 807.53 ± 0.04 mg/g DW. Substrate and acid ratio was optimized for pretreatment and found that a ratio of 4:50 yielded maximum total and reducing sugar of 102.80 ± 0.73 mg/g and 12.68 ± 0.86 mg/g DW, respectively. Sugars obtained from SMS were fermented using baker's yeast and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. The final yield of 1.57 g L-1 of ethanol was produced on day 4 when compared with the theoretical ethanol yield of 0.91 g L-1 obtained. The present study concludes that SMS from Ganoderma lucidum considered being an alternate choice for bioethanol production to meet the biofuel demand in the future and utilization of mushroom wastes to generate energy with the concept of zero-waste discharge was emphasized. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Necessity and exploitation of fossil fuels is unstoppable in meeting humanity's needs despite being a small and scarce resource. The use of different renewable feedstock materials are vital in the satisfaction of large-scale demand for renewable energy sources without creating environmental problems in order to satisfy energy demand. In this context we covered the production of biofuels from a variety of feedstocks using pyrolysis, direct blending, micro-emulsion, trans-esterification (biodiesel production techniques) and hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, methanogenesis (biogas production techniques) and pyrolysis, thermochemical liquefaction (bio-oil production techniques) along with the focus on increasing biofuel production using nanocatalysts and biochar-based catalysts and the techniques for creating those catalysts. Torrefaction, pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, hydrothermal liquefaction, and gasification are the key methods used to make biochar. Slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonisation are the best methods to produce high-yield biochar. Biochar's catalytic activity is influenced by pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time, transition metals, and biomass to water mass ratio. However, there are some noteworthy challenges associated with biofuel development. The cost of feedstock and the option of convenient technology for efficient fuel production, the availability of commercially viable nanoparticles, a biological understanding of the nanomaterial and protein system, and microorganism compatibility levels involving enzymes and nanomaterials are all discussed repeatedly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to global concern on the sustainability of energy from fossil fuels, isobutanol as a biofuel has urged attention in recent years due to its high octane number, higher blending capacity, low vapour pressure and higher energy content. The present study reports a novel wild strain, Candida glabrata, which produces isobutanol under submerged fermentation condition. Different process parameters have been optimized by both conventional as well as statistical methods. The production of isobutanol is enhanced in the presence of valine and this attribute the degradation pathway of valine is highly depend on isobutanol production. Under optimized condition, the yield of isobutanol is increased from 0.19 g/L to 0.96 g/L. This strain has not yet reported for the production of isobutanol. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Isobutanol is an attractive biofuel with many advantages. Third-generation biorefineries that convert CO2 into bio-based fuels have drawn considerable attention due to their lower feedstock cost and more ecofriendly refining process. Although autotrophic cyanobacteria have been genetically modified for isobutanol biosynthesis, there is a lack of stable and convenient strategies to improve their production. Results: In this study, we first engineered Synechococcus elongatus for isobutanol biosynthesis by introducing five exogenous enzymes, reaching a production titer of 0.126 g/L at day 20. It was then discovered that high salinity stress could result in a whopping fivefold increase in isobutanol production, with a maximal in-flask titer of 0.637 g/L at day 20. Metabolomics analysis revealed that high salinity stress substantially altered the metabolic profiles of the engineered S. elongatus. A major reason for the enhanced isobutanol production is the acceleration of lipid degradation under high salinity stress, which increases NADH. The NADH then participates in the engineered isobutanol-producing pathway. In addition, increased membrane permeability also contributed to the isobutanol production titer. A cultivation system was subsequently developed by mixing synthetic wastewater with seawater to grow the engineered cyanobacteria, reaching a similar isobutanol production titer as cultivation in the medium. Conclusions: High salinity stress on engineered cyanobacteria is a practical and feasible biotechnology to optimize isobutanol production. This biotechnology provides a cost-effective approach to biofuel production, and simultaneously recycles chemical nutrients from wastewater and seawater. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Over the last few years, valorization of lignocellulosic biomass has been expanded beyond the production of second-generation biofuels to the synthesis of numerous platform chemicals to be used instead of their fossil-based counterparts. One such well-researched example is 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which is preferably produced by the dehydration of fructose. Fructose is obtained by the isomerization of glucose, which in turn is derived by the hydrolysis of cellulose. However, to avoid harsh reaction conditions with high environmental impact, an isomerization step towards fructose is necessary, as fructose can be directly dehydrated to HMF under mild conditions. This work presents an optimized process to produce fructose from beechwood biomass hydrolysate and subsequently convert it to HMF by employing homogeneous catalysis. Results: The optimal saccharification conditions were identified at 10% wt. solids loading and 15 mg enzyme/gsolids, as determined from preliminary trials on pure cellulose (Avicel® PH-101). Furthermore, since high rate glucose isomerization to fructose requires the addition of sodium tetraborate, the optimum borate to glucose molar ratio was determined to 0.28 and was used in all experiments. Among 20 beechwood solid pulps obtained from different organosolv pretreatment conditions tested, the highest fructose production was obtained with acetone (160 °C, 120 min), reaching 56.8 g/100 g pretreated biomass. A scale-up hydrolysis in high solids (25% wt.) was then conducted. The hydrolysate was subjected to isomerization eventually leading to a high-fructose solution (104.5 g/L). Dehydration of fructose to HMF was tested with 5 different catalysts (HCl, H3PO4, formic acid, maleic acid and H-mordenite). Formic acid was found to be the best one displaying 79.9% sugars conversion with an HMF yield and selectivity of 44.6% and 55.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Overall, this work shows the feasibility of coupling bio- and chemo-catalytic processes to produce HMF from lignocellulose in an environmentally friendly manner. Further work for the deployment of biocatalysts for the oxidation of HMF to its derivatives could pave the way for the emergence of an integrated process to effectively produce biobased monomers from lignocellulose. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Lipids accumulated in the vegetative tissues of cellulosic feedstocks can be a potential raw material for biodiesel and bioethanol production. In this work, bagasse of genetically engineered sorghum was subjected to liquid hot-water pretreatment at 170, 180, and 190 °C for different reaction time. Under the optimal pretreatment condition (170 °C, 20 min), the residue was enriched in glucan (57.39 ± 2.63 % w/w) and xylan (13.38 ± 0.49 % w/w). The total lipid content of the pretreated residue was 6.81% w/w, similar to that observed in untreated bagasse (6.30% w/w). Pretreatment improved the enzymatic digestibility of bagasse, allowing a recovery of 79% w/w and 86% w/w of glucose and xylose, respectively. The pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification resulted in a 2-fold increase in total lipid in enzymatic residue compared to the original bagasse. Thus, pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis enabled high sugar recovery while concentrating triglycerides and free fatty acids in the residue. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the environmental impact of the production of a range of liquid biofuels produced from the combination of fermenting sorghum stalk juice (bioethanol) and the pyrolysis/hydrotreatment of residual bagasse (renewable gasoline and diesel). Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) was performed on a farm-to-wheels system that included: (i) sorghum farming, (ii) juice extraction, (iii) juice fermenting, (iv) bagasse pretreatment, (v) bagasse thermochemical treatment (pyrolysis, hydroprocessing, and steam reforming), and (vi) typical passenger vehicle operation. LCIA results were compared to those of petroleum fuels providing the equivalent functional unit—cumulative kilometers driven by spark ignition direct injection (SIDI) vehicles utilizing either renewable gasoline or ‘bioE85—a blend of bioethanol and renewable gasoline,’ and a compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) vehicle utilizing renewable diesel produced from 76 tons of harvested sweet sorghum (1 ha). Results: Sweet sorghum biofuels resulted in a 48% reduction climate change impact and a 52% reduction in fossil fuel depletion. Additionally, reduced impacts in ozone depletion and eutrophication were found (67% and 47%, respectively). Petroleum fuels had lower impacts for the categories of non-carcinogenic health impact, smog, respiratory effects, and ecotoxicity, showing tradeoffs between sorghum and petroleum fuels. Conclusion: Overall, sorghum biofuels provide advantages in environmental impact categories including global warming potential, fossil fuel depletion and eutrophication, showing potential for sorghum as a promising second-generation feedstock for fuel. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The present work describes an example Life Cycle Thinking (LCT), focused on environmental aspects of LCT. More in details, for biofuels, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is compulsory for certification of industrial sites since their sustainability must be in line with the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) requirements. Eni's Green Refinery is an example of the application of LCT. The paper describes a process, at R&D level, for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass deriving from crops not in conflict with the food sector. In particular, the process allows to obtain sugars from these lignocellulosic biomasses (saccharification section) and, once recovered, these sugars are used by oleaginous microrganisms (yeasts) in fermentations (fermentation section) for their growth. The lipids contained in yeast cells are recovered to produce a microbial oil that could be processed in an Ecofining™ plant, producing HVO (Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil). The environmental impact of advanced HVO has been compared with other biofuels pathways and with RED to prove its environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Fatty acid-based substances play an important role in many products, from food supplements to pharmaceutical products and biofuels. The production of fatty acids, mainly in their esterified form as triacylglycerol (TAG), has been intensively studied in oleaginous yeasts, whereas much less effort has been invested into non-oleaginous species. In the present work, we engineered the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is commonly regarded as non-oleaginous, for the storage of high amounts of TAG, comparable to the contents achieved in oleaginous yeasts. Results: We investigated the effects of several mutations with regard to increased TAG accumulation and identified six of them as important for this phenotype: a point mutation in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase Acc1p, overexpression of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase Dga1p, deletions of genes coding for enzymes involved in the competing pathways glycogen and steryl ester synthesis and TAG hydrolysis, and a deletion of CKB1, the gene coding for one of the regulatory subunits of casein kinase 2. With the combination of these mutations in a S. cerevisiae strain with a relatively high neutral lipid level already in the non-engineered state, we achieved a TAG content of 65% in the dry biomass. High TAG levels were not only obtained under conditions that favor lipid accumulation, but also in defined standard carbon-limited media. Conclusions: Baker's yeast, which is usually regarded as inefficient in the storage of TAG, can be converted into a highly oleaginous strain that could be useful in processes aiming at the synthesis of fatty acid-based products. This work emphasizes the importance of strain selection in combination with metabolic engineering to obtain high product levels. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The production of carbohydrate-enriched biomass from waste streams as a sustainable biofuel precursor is a noteworthy endeavor. This study investigates the long-term microalgae cultivated under low domestic wastewater loads and different hydraulic retention times (HRT) in a semi-continuous photobioreactor. The influence of operational conditions, the microalgae interaction with carbon, nutrients availability, and microbial population in terms of carbohydrate content were elucidated. The results revealed that the operation at similar low nutrients and carbon loads maintained at three different hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 10, 8, and 6 days caused different patterns in nutrients uptake and biomass composition. Particularly, the carbohydrate accumulation was greatly influenced by the unbalance in the N:P ratios than complete depletion of the nutrients. Hence, during the period operated at HRT of 10 d, high nutrients removal efficiencies were observed while gradually increasing carbohydrate content up to 57% in dry cell weight (DCW). Afterward, the decrease to 8 and 6 d of HRT showed lower nutrient consumption with depleted alkalinity, reaching an appreciably high carbohydrate accumulation of up to 46%, and 56%, respectively. The biomass concentration decreased in the order of HRT of 10, 8, and 6 days. This study demonstrated that microalgae adapted to low carbon and nutrient loads could still accumulate high carbohydrate at shorter HRT using domestic wastewater as substrate. © 2021

AB  - Background: As one of the major components of lignocellulosic biomass, lignin has been considered as the most abundant renewable aromatic feedstock in the world. Comparing with thermal or catalytic strategies for lignin degradation, biological conversion is a promising approach featuring with mild conditions and diversity, and has received great attention nowadays. Results: In this study, a consortium of white rot fungi composed of Lenzites betulina and Trametes versicolor was employed to enhance the ligninolytic enzyme activity of laccase (Lac) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) under microbial synergism. The maximum enzymatic activity of Lac and MnP was individually 18.06 U mL−1 and 13.58 U mL−1 along with a lignin degradation rate of 50% (wt/wt), which were achieved from batch cultivation of the consortium. The activities of Lac and MnP obtained from the consortium were both improved more than 40%, as compared with monocultures of L. betulina or T. versicolor under the same culture condition. The enhanced biodegradation performance was in accordance with the results observed from scanning electron microscope (SEM) of lignin samples before and after biodegradation, and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Finally, the analysis of heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) provided a comprehensive product mapping of the lignin biodegradation, suggesting that the lignin has undergone depolymerization of the macromolecules, side-chain cleavage, and aromatic ring-opening reactions. Conclusions: Our results revealed a considerable escalation on the enzymatic activity obtained in a short period from the cultivation of the L. betulina or T. versicolor due to the enhanced microbial synergistic effects, providing a potential bioconversion route for lignin utilization. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Trichoderma reesei is an ascomycete fungus known for its capability to secrete high amounts of extracellular cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes. These enzymes are utilized in the production of second-generation biofuels and T. reesei is a well-established host for their production. Although this species has gained considerable interest in the scientific literature, the sugar transportome of T. reesei remains poorly characterized. Better understanding of the proteins involved in the transport of different sugars could be utilized for engineering better enzyme production strains. In this study we aimed to shed light on this matter by characterizing multiple T. reesei transporters capable of transporting various types of sugars. We used phylogenetics to select transporters for expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes to screen for transport activities. Of the 18 tested transporters, 8 were found to be functional in oocytes. 10 transporters in total were investigated in oocytes and in yeast, and for 3 of them no transport function had been described in literature. This comprehensive analysis provides a large body of new knowledge about T. reesei sugar transporters, and further establishes X. laevis oocytes as a valuable tool for studying fungal sugar transporters. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The emao, a traditional beer starter used in the North–East regions of India produces a high quality of beer from rice substrates; however, its microbial community structure and functional metabolic modules remain unknown. To address this gap, we have used shot-gun whole-metagenome sequencing technology; accordingly, we have detected several enzymes that are known to catalyze saccharification, lignocellulose degradation, and biofuel production indicating the presence of metabolic functionome in the emao. The abundance of eukaryotic microorganisms, specifically the members of Mucoromycota and Ascomycota, dominated over the prokaryotes in the emao compared to previous metagenomic studies on such traditional starters where the relative abundance of prokaryotes occurred higher than the eukaryotes. The family Rhizopodaceae (64.5%) and its genus Rhizopus (64%) were the most dominant ones, followed by Phaffomycetaceae (11.14%) and its genus Wickerhamomyces (10.03%). The family Leuconostocaceae (6.09%) represented by two genera (Leuconostoc and Weissella) was dominant over the other bacteria, and it was the third-highest in overall relative abundance in the emao. The comprehensive microbial species diversity, community structure, and metabolic modules found in the emao are of practical value in the formulation of mixed-microbial cultures for biofuel production from plant-based feedstocks. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Future expansion of corn-derived ethanol raises concerns of sustainability and competition with the food industry. Therefore, cellulosic biofuels derived from agricultural waste and dedicated energy crops are necessary. To date, slow and incomplete saccharification as well as high enzyme costs have hindered the economic viability of cellulosic biofuels, and while approaches like simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and the use of thermotolerant microorganisms can enhance production, further improvements are needed. Cellulosic emulsions have been shown to enhance saccharification by increasing enzyme contact with cellulose fibers. In this study, we use these emulsions to develop an emulsified SSF (eSSF) process for rapid and efficient cellulosic biofuel production and make a direct three-way comparison of ethanol production between S. cerevisiae, O. polymorpha, and K. marxianus in glucose and cellulosic media at different temperatures. Results: In this work, we show that cellulosic emulsions hydrolyze rapidly at temperatures tolerable to yeast, reaching up to 40-fold higher conversion in the first hour compared to microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). To evaluate suitable conditions for the eSSF process, we explored the upper temperature limits for the thermotolerant yeasts Kluyveromyces marxianus and Ogataea polymorpha, as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and observed robust fermentation at up to 46, 50, and 42 °C for each yeast, respectively. We show that the eSSF process reaches high ethanol titers in short processing times, and produces close to theoretical yields at temperatures as low as 30 °C. Finally, we demonstrate the transferability of the eSSF technology to other products by producing the advanced biofuel isobutanol in a light-controlled eSSF using optogenetic regulators, resulting in up to fourfold higher titers relative to MCC SSF. Conclusions: The eSSF process addresses the main challenges of cellulosic biofuel production by increasing saccharification rate at temperatures tolerable to yeast. The rapid hydrolysis of these emulsions at low temperatures permits fermentation using non-thermotolerant yeasts, short processing times, low enzyme loads, and makes it possible to extend the process to chemicals other than ethanol, such as isobutanol. This transferability establishes the eSSF process as a platform for the sustainable production of biofuels and chemicals as a whole. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Production of biodiesel from renewable sources such as inedible vegetable oils by enzymatic catalysis has been a hotspot but remains a challenge on the efficient use of an enzyme. COFs (Covalent Organic Frameworks) with large surface area and porosity can be applied as ideal support to avoid aggregation of lipase and methanol. However, the naturally low density limits its application. In this work, we reported a facile synthesis of core–shell magnetic COF composite (Fe3O4@COF-OMe) to immobilize RML (Rhizomucor miehei lipase), to achieve its utilization in biodiesel production. Result: This strategy gives extrinsic magnetic property, and the magnetic COFs is much heavier and could disperse in water medium well, facilitating the attachment with the enzyme. The resultant biocomposite exhibited an excellent capacity of RML due to its high surface area and fast response to the external magnetic field, as well as good chemical stability. The core–shell magnetic COF-OMe structure not only achieved highly efficient immobilization and recovery processes but also maintained the activity of lipase to a great extent. RML@Fe3O4@COF-OMe performed well in practical applications, while free lipase did not. The biocomposite successfully achieved the production of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas Oil with a yield of about 70% in the optimized conditions. Conclusion: Magnetic COFs (Fe3O4@COF-OMe) for RML immobilization greatly improved catalytic performance in template reaction and biodiesel preparation. The magneticity makes it easily recovered and separated from the system. This first successful attempt of COFs-based immobilized enzyme broadened the prospect of biodiesel production by COFs with some inspiration. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The biodegradable fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is commonly composted to be used as fertilizer, but it also contains high value products in terms of energy content. The study of compost of MSW as a potential fuel, has rarely been reported in the literature while the study of its seasonal variation, in terms of fuel characteristics, has never been reported. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the compost-like output of MSW as potential fuel for a Waste-to-Energy (WtE) practice. In order to perform a representative evaluation, the seasonal variation of compost was also studied. More specifically, the combustion behavior of compost-like output (CLO) of the four different seasons and the co-combustion of CLOs blends with lignite were examined via several techniques: calorific value determination, thermogravimetric analysis, proximate and ultimate analysis. The emission factors and the empirical chemical formulas were calculated. Kinetics and thermodynamic parameters were determined. The results showed that the CLOs, despite its considerable seasonal variation, can be utilized as a sustainable fuel and is characterized by higher than lignite calorific value, lower ash production, lower sulfur oxide content and carbon dioxide emissions. During co-combustion, lower activation energy was found, suggesting a synergy effect. © 2021

AB  - Enzymatic pretreatment is emerging as an efficient tool for the extraction of biofuel precursors from algal biomass. However, yardsticks for end-use directed selection of optimal pretreatment conditions are not yet identified. The present study, for the first time, reveals different optimal conditions for algal biomass solubilization and sugar release. Algal biomass pretreatment optimization was carried out using the Taguchi method. Crude enzyme from Aspergillus fischeri was found effective for pretreatment of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Maximum sugar yield (190 mg g−1 biomass) from algal biomass was observed at a substrate concentration of 4 g L-1, with a 5% enzyme load at temperature 60°C, pH 5.5, and shaking speed of 80 rpm. In contrast, maximum sCOD (1350 mg g−1 biomass) was obtained at 2 g L−1 substrate concentration with enzyme load of 20% v/v, at 60°C, pH 4, and shaking speed of 100 rpm. Hence, the first set of conditions would be more beneficial for bioethanol production. Whereas another set of conditions would improve the biofuel production that requires maximum solubilization of algal biomass, such as fermentative methane production. Overall, the present observations established that process conditions required for enzymatic pretreatment of algal biomass should be selected according to the desired biofuel type. © 2021

AB  - Background: Identifying lignocellulose recalcitrant factors and exploring their genetic properties are essential for enhanced biomass enzymatic saccharification in bioenergy crops. Despite genetic modification of major wall polymers has been implemented for reduced recalcitrance in engineered crops, it could most cause a penalty of plant growth and biomass yield. Alternatively, it is increasingly considered to improve minor wall components, but an applicable approach is required for efficient assay of large population of biomass samples. Hence, this study collected total of 100 rice straw samples and characterized all minor wall monosaccharides and biomass enzymatic saccharification by integrating NIRS modeling and QTL profiling. Results: By performing classic chemical analyses and establishing optimal NIRS equations, this study examined four minor wall monosaccharides and major wall polymers (acid-soluble lignin/ASL, acid-insoluble lignin/AIL, three lignin monomers, crystalline cellulose), which led to largely varied hexoses yields achieved from enzymatic hydrolyses after two alkali pretreatments were conducted with large population of rice straws. Correlation analyses indicated that mannose and galactose can play a contrast role for biomass enzymatic saccharification at P < 0.0 l level (n = 100). Meanwhile, we found that the QTLs controlling mannose, galactose, lignin-related traits, and biomass saccharification were co-located. By combining NIRS assay with QTLs maps, this study further interpreted that the mannose-rich hemicellulose may assist AIL disassociation for enhanced biomass enzymatic saccharification, whereas the galactose-rich polysaccharides should be effectively extracted with ASL from the alkali pretreatment for condensed AIL association with cellulose microfibrils. Conclusions: By integrating NIRS assay with QTL profiling for large population of rice straw samples, this study has identified that the mannose content of wall polysaccharides could positively affect biomass enzymatic saccharification, while the galactose had a significantly negative impact. It has also sorted out that two minor monosaccharides could distinctively associate with lignin deposition for wall network construction. Hence, this study demonstrates an applicable approach for fast assessments of minor lignocellulose recalcitrant factors and biomass enzymatic saccharification in rice, providing a potential strategy for bioenergy crop breeding and biomass processing. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Tyrosinases and laccases are oxidoreductase enzymes that are used widely in the food, feed, textile, and biofuel industries. The rapidly growing industrial demand for bacterial oxido-reductases has encouraged research on this enzyme worldwide. These enzymes also play a key role in the formation of humic substances (HS) that are involved in controlling the biogeochemical carbon cycle, providing nutrients and bio-stimulants for plant growth, and interacting with inorganic and organic pollutants besides increasing carbon sequestration and mitigating greenhouse gas emission in the environment. The present study aimed to screen and characterize extracellular tyrosinase and laccase-producing soil bacteria that could be utilized in the polymerization of phenols. Results: Twenty isolates from different soil samples collected from forest ecosystems were characterized through ARDRA using restriction digestion with AluI, HpaII, and HaeIII restriction enzymes. The results of Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) revealed a 60 % similarity coefficient among 13 out of 20 isolates, of which, the isolate TFG5 exhibited only 10 % similarity when compared to all the other isolates. The isolate TFG5 exhibited both tyrosinase (1.34 U.mL− 1) and laccase (2.01 U.mL− 1) activity and was identified as Bacillus aryabhattai. The increased polymerization activity was observed when B. aryabhattai TFG5 was treated with phenols. The monomers such as catechol, p-Hydroxy benzoic acid, ferulic acid, and salicylic acid were polymerized efficiently, as evidenced by their FT-IR spectra depicting increased functional groups compared to the standard mushroom tyrosinase. Conclusions: The polymerization ability of B. aryabhattai TFG5 could be applied to phenol-rich wastewater treatment for efficient precipitation of phenols. Furthermore, tyrosinases can be used for enhancing the synthesis of HS in soil. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Fungi produce enzymes that degrade the complex lignin thereby enabling the efficient utilization of plant lignocellulosic biomass in the production of biofuel and cellulose-based products. In the present study, the agricultural residues such as paddy straw, sugarcane bagasse, and coconut husk were used as substrates for the biodegradation by Aspergillus nomius (MN700028) and Trichoderma harzianum (MN700029) isolated from gut of the termite, Odontotermes obesus and fungus comb in the termite mound, respectively. The influence of varying concentrations of different carbon sources, pH, and temperature on ligninolytic enzyme production was examined under laboratory conditions. The highest activities of manganese peroxidase (0.24 U/mL), lignin peroxidase (10.38 U/mL) and laccase (0.05 U/mL) were observed under studied conditions. Fungal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for 45 days showed that A. nomius and T. harzianum degraded 84.4% and 81.66% of hemicelluloses, 8.16% and 93.75% of cellulose, and 52.59% and 65% of lignin, respectively. The interaction of pH, temperature, and different carbon sources with fungal biomass and enzyme production was found significant (p ≤ 0.05). SEM analysis indicated alterations in the microstructures of degraded lignocellulosic substrates. A. nomius and T. harzianum were highly efficient in ligninolytic enzymes production and in vitro digestibility of agricultural residues. The study reports the production of laccase by A. nomius isolated from termite gut for the first time. The fungal isolates A. nomius and T. harzianum posses potential for ligninocellulosic waste degradation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Pretreatment is a critical step required for efficient conversion of woody biomass into biofuels and platform chemicals. Fungal pretreatment is regarded as one of the most promising technology for woody biomass conversion but remains challenging for industrial application. The exploration of potential fungus strain with high efficient delignification and less processing time for woody biomass pretreatment will be valuable for development of biorefinery industry. Here, a newly isolated white-rot basidiomycete Peniophora incarnate T-7 was employed for poplar wood pretreatment. Results: The chemical component analysis showed that cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin from poplar wood declined by 16%, 48% and 70%, respectively, after 7 days submerged fermentation by P. incarnate T-7. Enzymatic saccharification analysis revealed that the maximum yields of glucose and xylose from 7 days of P. incarnate T-7 treated poplar wood reached 33.4% and 27.6%, respectively, both of which were enhanced by sevenfold relative to the untreated group. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) characterization confirmed that lignocellulosic structure of poplar wood was largely broken by P. incarnate T-7, including delignification and de-crystalline of cellulose. Meanwhile, lignin component of poplar wood was selectively degraded by P. incarnate T-7, and G-type unit of lignin was preferentially attacked by the strain. Furthermore, quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that a considerable amount of lignocellulolytic enzymes were detected in the secretory proteins of P. incarnate T-7, especially with high abundance of lignin-degrading enzymes and hemicellulases. Combination of quantitative proteomic with transcriptomic analysis results showed that most of those lignocellulolytic enzymes were highly upregulated on poplar wood substrate compared to glucose substrate. Conclusions: This study showed that P. incarnate T-7 could selectively delignify poplar wood by submerged fermentation with short time of 7 days, which greatly improved its enzymatic saccharification efficiency. Our results suggested that P. incarnate T-7 might be a promising candidate for industrial woody biomass pretreatment. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) is one of the two key cyanobacterial enzymes along with aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) involved in the synthesis of long-chain alkanes, a drop-in biofuel. The enzyme is prone to aggregation when expressed in Escherichia coli, leading to varying alkane levels. The present work attempts to investigate the crucial structural aspects of AAR protein associated with its stability and folding. Characterization by dynamic light scattering experiment and intact mass spectrometry revealed that recombinantly expressed AAR in E. coli existed in multiple-sized protein particles due to diverse lipidation. Interestingly, while thermal- and urea-based denaturation of AAR showed 2-state unfolding transition in circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescent spectroscopy, the unfolding process of AAR was a 3-state pathway in GdnHCl solution suggesting that the protein milieu plays a significant role in dictating its folding. Apparent standard free energy (ΔGNUH2O) of ~ 4.5 kcal/mol for the steady-state unfolding of AAR indicated borderline stability of the protein. Based on these evidences, we propose that the marginal stability of AAR are plausible contributing reasons for aggregation propensity and hence the low catalytic activity of the enzyme when expressed in E. coli for biofuel production. Our results show a path for building superior biocatalyst for higher biofuel production. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Nowadays there is a strong trend towards a circular economy using lignocellulosic biowaste for the production of biofuels and other bio-based products. The use of enzymes at several stages of the production process (e.g., saccharification) can offer a sustainable route due to avoidance of harsh chemicals and high temperatures. For novel enzyme discovery, physically linked gene clusters targeting carbohydrate degradation in bacteria, polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), are recognized ‘treasure troves’ in the era of exponentially growing numbers of sequenced genomes. Results: We determined the biochemical properties and structure of a protein of unknown function (PUF) encoded within PULs of metagenomes from beaver droppings and moose rumen enriched on poplar hydrolysate. The corresponding novel bifunctional carbohydrate esterase (CE), now named BD-FAE, displayed feruloyl esterase (FAE) and acetyl esterase activity on simple, synthetic substrates. Whereas acetyl xylan esterase (AcXE) activity was detected on acetylated glucuronoxylan from birchwood, only FAE activity was observed on acetylated and feruloylated xylooligosaccharides from corn fiber. The genomic contexts of 200 homologs of BD-FAE revealed that the 33 closest homologs appear in PULs likely involved in xylan breakdown, while the more distant homologs were found either in alginate-targeting PULs or else outside PUL contexts. Although the BD-FAE structure adopts a typical α/β-hydrolase fold with a catalytic triad (Ser-Asp-His), it is distinct from other biochemically characterized CEs. Conclusions: The bifunctional CE, BD-FAE, represents a new candidate for biomass processing given its capacity to remove ferulic acid and acetic acid from natural corn and birchwood xylan substrates, respectively. Its detailed biochemical characterization and solved crystal structure add to the toolbox of enzymes for biomass valorization as well as structural information to inform the classification of new CEs. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Microalgae have received significant attention as potential next-generation microbiologic cell factories for biofuels. However, the production of microalgal biofuels is not yet sufficiently cost-effective for commercial applications. To screen higher lipid-producing strains, heavy carbon ion beams are applied to induce a genetic mutant. An RNA-seq technology is used to identify the pathways and genes of importance related to photosynthesis and biofuel production. The deep elucidation of photosynthesis and the fatty acid metabolism pathway involved in lipid yield is valuable information for further optimization studies. This study provided the photosynthetic efficiency and transcriptome profiling of a unicellular microalgae, Scenedesmus obliqnus mutant SO120G, with enhanced lipid production induced by heavy carbon ion beams. The lipid yield (52.5 mg L−1) of SO120G mutant were enhanced 2.4 fold compared with that of the wild strain under the nitrogen deficient condition. In addition, the biomass and growth rate were 57% and 25% higher, respectively, in SO120G than in the wild type, likely owing to an improved maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) of photosynthesis. As for the major pigment compositions, the content of chlorophyll a and carotenoids was higher in SO120G than in the wild type. The transcriptome data confirmed that a total of 2077 genes with a change of at least twofold were recognized as differential expression genes (DEGs), of which 1060 genes were up-regulated and 1017 genes were down-regulated. Most of the DEGs involved in lipid biosynthesis were up-regulated with the mutant SO120G. The expression of the gene involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis and photosynthesis of SO120G was upregulated, while that related to starch metabolism decreased compared with that of the wild strain. This work demonstrated that heavy-ion irradiation is an promising strategy for quality improvement. In addition, the mutant SO120G was shown to be a potential algal strain for enhanced lipid production. Transcriptome sequencing and annotation of the mutant suggested the possible genes responsible for lipid biosynthesis and photosynthesis, and identified the putative target genes for future genetic manipulation and biotechnological applications. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Microbial oils, generated from lignocellulosic material, have great potential as renewable and sustainable alternatives to fossil-based fuels and chemicals. By unravelling the diversity of lipid accumulation physiology in different oleaginous yeasts grown on the various carbon sources present in lignocellulose hydrolysate (LH), new targets for optimisation of lipid accumulation can be identified. Monitoring lipid formation over time is essential for understanding lipid accumulation physiology. This study investigated lipid accumulation in a variety of oleaginous ascomycetous and basidiomycetous strains grown in glucose and xylose and followed lipid formation kinetics of selected strains in wheat straw hydrolysate (WSH). Results: Twenty-nine oleaginous yeast strains were tested for their ability to utilise glucose and xylose, the main sugars present in WSH. Evaluation of sugar consumption and lipid accumulation revealed marked differences in xylose utilisation capacity between the yeast strains, even between those belonging to the same species. Five different promising strains, belonging to the species Lipomyces starkeyi, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula babjevae and Rhodotorula toruloides, were grown on undiluted wheat straw hydrolysate and lipid accumulation was followed over time, using Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. All five strains were able to grow on undiluted WSH and to accumulate lipids, but to different extents and with different productivities. R. babjevae DVBPG 8058 was the best-performing strain, accumulating 64.8% of cell dry weight (CDW) as lipids. It reached a culture density of 28 g/L CDW in batch cultivation, resulting in a lipid content of 18.1 g/L and yield of 0.24 g lipids per g carbon source. This strain formed lipids from the major carbon sources in hydrolysate, glucose, acetate and xylose. R. glutinis CBS 2367 also consumed these carbon sources, but when assimilating xylose it consumed intracellular lipids simultaneously. Rhodotorula strains contained a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids than the two tested Lipomyces starkeyi strains. Conclusions: There is considerable metabolic diversity among oleaginous yeasts, even between closely related species and strains, especially when converting xylose to biomass and lipids. Monitoring the kinetics of lipid accumulation and identifying the molecular basis of this diversity are keys to selecting suitable strains for high lipid production from lignocellulose. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: β-Caryophyllene is a plant terpenoid with therapeutic and biofuel properties. Production of terpenoids through microbial cells is a potentially sustainable alternative for production. Adaptive laboratory evolution is a complementary technique to metabolic engineering for strain improvement, if the product-of-interest is coupled with growth. Here we use a combination of pathway engineering and adaptive laboratory evolution to improve the production of β-caryophyllene, an extracellular product, by leveraging the antioxidant potential of the compound. Results: Using oxidative stress as selective pressure, we developed an adaptive laboratory evolution that worked to evolve an engineered β-caryophyllene producing yeast strain for improved production within a few generations. This strategy resulted in fourfold increase in production in isolated mutants. Further increasing the flux to β-caryophyllene in the best evolved mutant achieved a titer of 104.7 ± 6.2 mg/L product. Genomic analysis revealed a gain-of-function mutation in the a-factor exporter STE6 was identified to be involved in significantly increased production, likely as a result of increased product export. Conclusion: An optimized selection strategy based on oxidative stress was developed to improve the production of the extracellular product β-caryophyllene in an engineered yeast strain. Application of the selection strategy in adaptive laboratory evolution resulted in mutants with significantly increased production and identification of novel responsible mutations. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive renewable resource to produce biofuel or platform chemicals. Efficient and cost-effective conversion systems of lignocellulosic biomass depend on their appropriate pretreatment processes. Alkali or dilute acid pretreatment of biomass requires a high temperature (> 150 °C) to remove xylan (hemicellulosic sugar) and lignin partially. In this study, peracetic acid was used to pretreat biomass feedstocks, including hardwood and softwood species. It was found that the thermally-assisted dilute acid pretreatment of biomass conducted under the mild temperature of 90 °C up to 5 h resulted in the effective removal of lignin from the biomass with a negligible loss of carbohydrates. This thermally-assisted pretreatment achieved 90% of delignification, and this result was compared with the microwave-assisted pretreatment method. In addition, the crystallinity index (CrI), surface morphology, and chemical structure were significantly changed after the acid pretreatment. The biomass digestibility increased significantly with increased reaction time, by 32% and 23% for hardwood and softwood, respectively. From this study, it is clear that peracetic acid pretreatment is an effective method to enrich glucan content in biomass by delignification. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Trichoderma genus fungi present great potential for the production of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZYmes), including glycoside hydrolase (GH) family members. From a renewability perspective, CAZYmes can be biotechnologically exploited to convert plant biomass into free sugars for the production of advanced biofuels and other high-value chemicals. GH54 is an attractive enzyme family for biotechnological applications because many GH54 enzymes are bifunctional. Thus, GH54 enzymes are interesting targets in the search for new enzymes for use in industrial processes such as plant biomass conversion. Herein, a novel metal-dependent GH54 arabinofuranosidase (ThABF) from the cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma harzianum was identified and biochemically characterized. Initial in silico searches were performed to identify the GH54 sequence. Next, the gene was cloned and heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified, and the enzyme’s biochemical and biophysical properties were assessed. GH54 members show wide functional diversity and specifically remove plant cell substitutions including arabinose and galactose in the presence of a metallic cofactor. Plant cell wall substitution has a major impact on lignocellulosic substrate conversion into high-value chemicals. These results expand the known functional diversity of the GH54 family, showing the potential of a novel arabinofuranosidase for plant biomass degradation. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Lignocellulolytic enzymes are essential for agricultural waste disposal and production of renewable bioenergy. Many commercialized cellulase mixtures have been developed, mostly from saprophytic or endophytic fungal species. The cost of complete cellulose digestion is considerable because a wide range of cellulolytic enzymes is needed. However, most fungi can only produce limited range of highly bioactive cellulolytic enzymes. We aimed to investigate a simple yet specific method for discovering unique enzymes so that fungal species producing a diverse group of cellulolytic enzymes can be identified. Results: The culture medium of an endophytic fungus, Daldinia caldariorum D263, contained a complete set of cellulolytic enzymes capable of effectively digesting cellulose residues into glucose. By taking advantage of the unique product inhibition property of β-glucosidases, we have established an improved zymography method that can easily distinguish β-glucosidase and exoglucanase activity. Our zymography method revealed that D263 can secrete a wide range of highly bioactive cellulases. Analyzing the assembled genome of D263, we found over 100 potential genes for cellulolytic enzymes that are distinct from those of the commercially used fungal species Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus niger. We further identified several of these cellulolytic enzymes by mass spectrometry. Conclusions: The genome of Daldinia caldariorum D263 has been sequenced and annotated taking advantage of a simple yet specific zymography method followed by mass spectrometry analysis, and it appears to encode and secrete a wide range of bioactive cellulolytic enzymes. The genome and cellulolytic enzyme secretion of this unique endophytic fungus should be of value for identifying active cellulolytic enzymes that can facilitate conversion of agricultural wastes to fermentable sugars for the industrial production of biofuels. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration contributes to low back pain. The avascular intervertebral disc consists of a central hypoxic nucleus pulpous (NP) surrounded by the more oxygenated annulus fibrosus (AF). Lactic acid, an abundant end-product of NP glycolysis, has long been viewed as a harmful waste that acidifies disc tissue and decreases cell viability and function. As lactic acid is readily converted into lactate in disc tissue, the objective of this study was to determine whether lactate could be used by AF cells as a carbon source rather than being removed from disc tissue as a waste byproduct. Methods: Import and conversion of lactate to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and amino acids in rabbit AF cells were measured by heavy-isotope (13C-lactate) tracing experiments using mass spectrometry. Levels of protein expression of lactate converting enzymes, lactate importer and exporter in NP and AF tissues were quantified by Western blots. Effects of lactate on proteoglycan (35S-sulfate) and collagen (3H-proline) matrix protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation (Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer) in AF cells were assessed. Results: Heavy-isotope tracing experiments revealed that AF cells imported and converted lactate into TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids using in vitro cell culture and in vivo models. Addition of exogenous lactate (4 mM) in culture media induced expression of the lactate importer MCT1 and increased oxygen consumption rate by 50%, mitochondrial ATP-linked respiration by 30%, and collagen synthesis by 50% in AF cell cultures grown under physiologic oxygen (2-5% O2) and glucose concentration (1-5 mM). AF tissue highly expresses MCT1, LDH-H, an enzyme that preferentially converts lactate to pyruvate, and PDH, an enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-coA. In contrast, NP tissue highly expresses MCT4, a lactate exporter, and LDH-M, an enzyme that preferentially converts pyruvate to lactate. Conclusions: These findings support disc lactate-dependent metabolic symbiosis in which lactate produced by the hypoxic, glycolytic NP cells is utilized by the more oxygenated AF cells via oxidative phosphorylation for energy and matrix production, thus shifting the current research paradigm of viewing disc lactate as a waste product to considering it as an important biofuel. These scientifically impactful results suggest novel therapeutic targets in disc metabolism and degeneration. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model green alga strain for molecular studies; its fully sequenced genome has enabled omic-based analyses that have been applied to better understand its metabolic responses to stress. Here, we characterised physiological and proteomic changes between a low-starch C. reinhardtii strain and the snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis, to reveal insights into their contrasting responses to salinity stress. Results: Each strain was grown in conditions tailored to their growth requirements to encourage maximal fatty acid (as a proxy measure of lipid) production, with internal controls to allow comparison points. In 0.2 M NaCl, C. nivalis accumulates carbohydrates up to 10.4% DCW at 80 h, and fatty acids up to 52.0% dry cell weight (DCW) over 12 days, however, C. reinhardtii does not show fatty acid accumulation over time, and shows limited carbohydrate accumulation up to 5.5% DCW. Analysis of the C. nivalis fatty acid profiles showed that salt stress improved the biofuel qualities over time. Photosynthesis and respiration rates are reduced in C. reinhardtii relative to C. nivalis in response to 0.2 M NaCl. De novo sequencing and homology matching was used in conjunction with iTRAQ-based quantitative analysis to identify and relatively quantify proteomic alterations in cells exposed to salt stress. There were abundance differences in proteins associated with stress, photosynthesis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism proteins. In terms of lipid synthesis, salt stress induced an increase in dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase in C. nivalis (1.1-fold change), whilst levels in C. reinhardtii remained unaffected; this enzyme is involved in acetyl CoA production and has been linked to TAG accumulation in microalgae. In salt-stressed C. nivalis there were decreases in the abundance of UDP-sulfoquinovose (− 1.77-fold change), which is involved in sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol metabolism, and in citrate synthase (− 2.7-fold change), also involved in the TCA cycle. Decreases in these enzymes have been shown to lead to increased TAG production as fatty acid biosynthesis is favoured. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD018148. Conclusions: These differences in protein abundance have given greater understanding of the mechanism by which salt stress promotes fatty acid accumulation in the un-sequenced microalga C. nivalis as it switches to a non-growth state, whereas C. reinhardtii does not have this response. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Production of biofuels and green chemicals by microbes is currently of great interest due to the increasingly limited reserves of fossil fuels. Biodiesel, especially fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), is considered as an attractive alternative because of its similarity with petrodiesel and compatibility with existing infrastructures. Cost-efficient bio-production of FAEEs requires a highly lipogenic production host that is suitable for large-scale fermentation. As a non-model oleaginous yeast that can be cultured to an extremely high cell density and accumulate over 70% cell mass as lipids, Rhodotorula toruloides represents an attractive host for FAEEs production. Results: We first constructed the FAEE biosynthetic pathways in R. toruloides by introducing various wax ester synthase genes from different sources, and the bifunctional wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA-diacyglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT) gene from Acinetobacter baylyi was successfully expressed, leading to a production of 826 mg/L FAEEs through shake-flask cultivation. We then mutated this bifunctional enzyme to abolish the DGAT activity, and further improved the titer to 1.02 g/L. Finally, to elevate the performance of Δku70-AbWS* in a bioreactor, both batch and fed-batch cultivation strategies were performed. The FAEEs titer, productivity and yield were 4.03 g/L, 69.5 mg/L/h and 57.9 mg/g (mg FAEEs/g glucose) under batch cultivation, and 9.97 g/L, 90.6 mg/L/h, and 86.1 mg/g under fed-batch cultivation. It is worth mentioning that most of the produced FAEEs were secreted out of the cell, which should greatly reduce the cost of downstream processing. Conclusion: We achieved the highest FAEEs production in yeast with a final titer of 9.97 g/L and demonstrated that the engineered R. toruloides has the potential to serve as a platform strain for efficient production of fatty acid-derived molecules. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Controlled, stable and uniform temperature environment with quick response are crucial needs for many lab-on-chip (LOC) applications requiring thermal management. Laser Induced Graphene (LIG) heater is one such mechanism capable of maintaining a wide range of steady state temperature. LIG heaters are thin, flexible, and inexpensive and can be fabricated easily in different geometric configurations. In this perspective, herein, the electro-thermal performance of the LIG heater has been examined for different laser power values and scanning speeds. The experimented laser ablated patterns exhibited varying electrical conductivity corresponding to different combinations of power and speed of the laser. The conductivity of the pattern can be tailored by tuning the parameters which exhibit, a wide range of temperatures making them suitable for diverse lab-on-chip applications. A maximum temperature of 589 °C was observed for a combination of 15% laser power and 5.5% scanning speed. A LOC platform was realized by integrating the developed LIG heaters with a droplet-based microfluidic device. The performance of this LOC platform was analyzed for effective use of LIG heaters to synthesize Gold nanoparticles (GNP). Finally, the functionality of the synthesized GNPs was validated by utilizing them as catalyst in enzymatic glucose biofuel cell and in electrochemical applications. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Type I fatty acid synthases (FASs) are critical metabolic enzymes which are common targets for bioengineering in the production of biofuels and other products. Serendipitously, we identified FAS as a contaminant in a cryoEM dataset of virus-like particles (VLPs) purified from P. pastoris, an important model organism and common expression system used in protein production. From these data, we determined the structure of P. pastoris FAS to 3.1 Å resolution. While the overall organisation of the complex was typical of type I FASs, we identified several differences in both structural and enzymatic domains through comparison with the prototypical yeast FAS from S. cerevisiae. Using focussed classification, we were also able to resolve and model the mobile acyl-carrier protein (ACP) domain, which is key for function. Ultimately, the structure reported here will be a useful resource for further efforts to engineer yeast FAS for synthesis of alternate products. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Lipids are important precursors in the biofuel and oleochemical industries. Yarrowia lipolytica is among the most extensively studied oleaginous microorganisms and has been a focus of metabolic engineering to improve lipid production. Yield improvement, through rewiring of the central carbon metabolism of Y. lipolytica from glucose to the lipid precursor acetyl-CoA, is a key strategy for achieving commercial success in this organism. Results: Building on YB-392, a Y. lipolytica isolate known for stable non-hyphal growth and low citrate production with demonstrated potential for high lipid accumulation, we assembled a heterologous pathway that redirects carbon flux from glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to acetyl-CoA. We used phosphofructokinase (Pfk) deletion to block glycolysis and expressed two non-native enzymes, phosphoketolase (Xpk) and phosphotransacetylase (Pta), to convert PPP-produced xylulose-5-P to acetyl-CoA. Introduction of the pathway in a pfk deletion strain that is unable to grow and accumulate lipid from glucose in defined media ensured maximal redirection of carbon flux through Xpk/Pta. Expression of Xpk and Pta restored growth and lipid production from glucose. In 1-L bioreactors, the engineered strains recorded improved lipid yield and cell-specific productivity by up to 19 and 78%, respectively. Conclusions: Yields and cell-specific productivities are important bioprocess parameters for large-scale lipid fermentations. Improving these parameters by engineering the Xpk/Pta pathway is an important step towards developing Y. lipolytica as an industrially preferred microbial biocatalyst for lipid production. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Zymomonas mobilis is an aerotolerant α-proteobacterium, which has been genetically engineered for industrial purposes for decades. However, a comprehensive comparison of existing strains on the genomic level in conjunction with phenotype analysis has yet to be carried out. We here performed whole-genome comparison of 17 strains including nine that were sequenced in this study. We then compared 15 available Zymomonas strains for their natural abilities to perform under conditions relevant to biofuel synthesis. We tested their growth in anaerobic rich media, as well as growth, ethanol production and xylose utilization in lignocellulosic hydrolysate. We additionally compared their tolerance to isobutanol, flocculation characteristics, and ability to uptake foreign DNA by electroporation and conjugation. Results: Using clustering based on 99% average nucleotide identity (ANI), we classified 12 strains into four clusters based on sequence similarity, while five strains did not cluster with any other strain. Strains belonging to the same 99% ANI cluster showed similar performance while significant variation was observed between the clusters. Overall, conjugation and electroporation efficiencies were poor across all strains, which was consistent with our finding of coding potential for several DNA defense mechanisms, such as CRISPR and restriction–modification systems, across all genomes. We found that strain ATCC31821 (ZM4) had a more diverse plasmid profile than other strains, possibly leading to the unique phenotypes observed for this strain. ZM4 also showed the highest growth of any strain in both laboratory media and lignocellulosic hydrolysate and was among the top 3 strains for isobutanol tolerance and electroporation and conjugation efficiency. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that strain ZM4 has a unique combination of genetic and phenotypic traits that are beneficial for biofuel production and propose investing future efforts in further engineering of ZM4 for industrial purposes rather than exploring new Zymomonas isolates. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Rhodosporidium strain, a well-known oleaginous yeast, has been widely used as a platform for lipid and carotenoid production. However, the production of squalene for application in lipid-based biofuels is not reported in this strain. Here, a new strain of Rhodosporidium sp. was isolated and identified, and its potential was investigated for production of squalene under various cultivation conditions. Results: In the present study, Rhodosporidium sp. DR37 was isolated from mangrove ecosystem and its potential for squalene production was assessed. When Rhodosporidium sp. DR37 was cultivated on modified YEPD medium (20 g/L glucose, 5 g/L peptone, 5 g/L YE, seawater (50% v/v), pH 7, 30 °C), 64 mg/L of squalene was produced. Also, squalene content was obtained as 13.9% of total lipid. Significantly, use of optimized medium (20 g/L sucrose, 5 g/L peptone, seawater (20% v/v), pH 7, 25 °C) allowed highest squalene accumulation (619 mg/L) and content (21.6% of total lipid) in Rhodosporidium sp. DR37. Moreover, kinetic parameters including maximum specific cell growth rate (μmax, h−1), specific lipid accumulation rate (qp, h−1), specific squalene accumulation rate (qsq, h−1) and specific sucrose consumption rate (qs, h−1) were determined in optimized medium as 0.092, 0.226, 0.036 and 0.010, respectively. Conclusions: This study is the first report to employ marine oleaginous Rhodosporidium sp. DR37 for accumulation of squalene in optimized medium. These findings provide the potential of Rhodosporidium sp. DR37 for production of squalene as well as lipid and carotenoids for biofuel applications in large scale.

AB  - Background: Mitigation of climate change requires that new routes for the production of fuels and chemicals be as oil-independent as possible. The microbial conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into terpene-based biofuels and bioproducts represents one such route. This work builds upon previous demonstrations that the single-celled carotenogenic basidiomycete, Rhodosporidium toruloides, is a promising host for the production of terpenes from lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Results: This study focuses on the optimization of production of the monoterpene 1,8-cineole and the sesquiterpene α-bisabolene in R. toruloides. The α-bisabolene titer attained in R. toruloides was found to be proportional to the copy number of the bisabolene synthase (BIS) expression cassette, which in turn influenced the expression level of several native mevalonate pathway genes. The addition of more copies of BIS under a stronger promoter resulted in production of α-bisabolene at 2.2 g/L from lignocellulosic hydrolysate in a 2-L fermenter. Production of 1,8-cineole was found to be limited by availability of the precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and expression of an appropriate GPP synthase increased the monoterpene titer fourfold to 143 mg/L at bench scale. Targeted mevalonate pathway metabolite analysis suggested that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MK) and phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) may be pathway bottlenecks are were therefore selected as targets for overexpression. Expression of HMGR, MK, and PMK orthologs and growth in an optimized lignocellulosic hydrolysate medium increased the 1,8-cineole titer an additional tenfold to 1.4 g/L. Expression of the same mevalonate pathway genes did not have as large an impact on α-bisabolene production, although the final titer was higher at 2.6 g/L. Furthermore, mevalonate pathway intermediates accumulated in the mevalonate-engineered strains, suggesting room for further improvement. Conclusions: This work brings R. toruloides closer to being able to make industrially relevant quantities of terpene from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Light/dark cycling is an inherent condition of outdoor microalgae cultivation, but is often unfavorable for lipid accumulation. This study aims to identify promising targets for metabolic engineering of improved lipid accumulation under outdoor conditions. Consequently, the lipid-rich mutant Chlamydomonas sp. KOR1 was developed through light/dark-conditioned screening. During dark periods with depressed CO2 fixation, KOR1 shows rapid carbohydrate degradation together with increased lipid and carotenoid contents. KOR1 was subsequently characterized with extensive mutation of the ISA1 gene encoding a starch debranching enzyme (DBE). Dynamic time-course profiling and metabolomics reveal dramatic changes in KOR1 metabolism throughout light/dark cycles. During light periods, increased flux from CO2 through glycolytic intermediates is directly observed to accompany enhanced formation of small starch-like particles, which are then efficiently repartitioned in the next dark cycle. This study demonstrates that disruption of DBE can improve biofuel production under light/dark conditions, through accelerated carbohydrate repartitioning into lipid and carotenoid. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Algal biofuel research aims to make a renewable, carbon–neutral biofuel by using oil-producing microalgae. The freshwater microalga Botryococcus braunii has received much attention due to its ability to accumulate large amounts of petroleum-like hydrocarbons but suffers from slow growth. We performed a large-scale screening of fast-growing strains with 180 strains isolated from 22 ponds located in a wide geographic range from the tropics to cool-temperate. A fast-growing strain, Showa, which recorded the highest productivities of algal hydrocarbons to date, was used as a benchmark. The initial screening was performed by monitoring optical densities in glass tubes and identified 9 wild strains with faster or equivalent growth rates to Showa. The biomass-based assessments showed that biomass and hydrocarbon productivities of these strains were 12–37% and 11–88% higher than that of Showa, respectively. One strain, OIT-678 established a new record of the fastest growth rate in the race B strains with a doubling time of 1.2 days. The OIT-678 had 36% higher biomass productivity, 34% higher hydrocarbon productivity, and 20% higher biomass density than Showa at the same cultivation conditions, suggesting the potential of the new strain to break the record for the highest productivities of hydrocarbons. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The increasing demand and the continuous depletion in fossil fuels have persuaded researchers to investigate new sources of renewable energy. Bioethanol produced from cellulose could be a cost-effective and a viable alternative to petroleum. It is worth note that β-glucosidase plays a key role in the hydrolysis of cellulose and therefore in the production of bioethanol. This study aims to investigate a simple and standardized method for maximization of extracellular β-glucosidase production from a novel fungal isolate under solid-state fermentation using agro-industrial residues as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Furthermore, purification and characterization of β-glucosidase were performed to determine the conditions under which the enzyme displayed the highest performance. Results: A fungus identified genetically as a new Aspergillus sp. DHE7 was found to exhibit the highest extracellular β-glucosidase production among the sixty fungal isolates tested. Optimization of culture conditions improved the enzyme biosynthesis by 2.1-fold (174.6 ± 5.8 U/g of dry substrate) when the fungus grown for 72 h at 35 °C on jojoba meal with 60% of initial substrate moisture, pH 6.0, and an inoculum size of 2.54 × 107 spores/mL. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity through a multi-step purification process. The purified β-glucosidase is monomeric with a molecular mass of 135 kDa as revealed by the SDS-PAGE analysis. Optimum activity was observed at 60 °C and pH of 6.0, with a remarkable pH and thermal stability. The enzyme retained about 79% and 53% of its activity, after 1 h at 70 °C and 80 °C, respectively. The purified β-glucosidase hydrolysed a wide range of substrates but displaying its greater activity on p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside and cellobiose. The values of Km and Vmax on p-nitrophenyl β-D-glucopyranoside were 0.4 mM and 232.6 U/mL, respectively. Purified β-glucosidase displayed high catalytic activity (improved by 25%) in solutions contained ethanol up to 15%. Conclusion: β-glucosidase characteristics associated with its ability to hydrolyse cellobiose, underscore its utilization in improving the quality of food and beverages. In addition, taking into consideration that the final concentration of ethanol produced by the conventional methods is about 10%, suggests its use in ethanol-containing industrial processes and in the saccharification processes for bioethanol production.

AB  - Background: Epidermal cell walls have special structural and biological roles in the life of the plant. Typically they are multi-ply structures encrusted with waxes and cutin which protect the plant from dehydration and pathogen attack. These characteristics may also reduce chemical and enzymatic deconstruction of the wall for sugar analysis and conversion to biofuels. We have assessed the saccharide composition of the outer epidermal wall of onion scales with different analytical methods. This wall is a particularly useful model for cell wall imaging and mechanics. Results: Epidermal walls were depolymerized by acidic methanolysis combined with 2M trifluoracetic acid hydrolysis and the resultant sugars were analyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). Total sugar yields based on wall dry weight were low (53%). Removal of waxes with chloroform increased the sugar yields to 73% and enzymatic digestion did not improve these yields. Analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of per-O-trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of the sugar methyl glycosides produced by acidic methanolysis gave a high yield for galacturonic acid (GalA) but glucose (Glc) was severely reduced. In a complementary fashion, GC/MS analysis of methyl alditols produced by permethylation gave substantial yields for glucose and other neutral sugars, but GalA was severely reduced. Analysis of the walls by 13C solid-state NMR confirmed and extended these results and revealed 15% lipid content after chloroform extraction (potentially cutin and unextractable waxes). Conclusions: Although exact values vary with the analytical method, our best estimate is that polysaccharide in the outer epidermal wall of onion scales is comprised of homogalacturonan (~ 50%), cellulose (~ 20%), galactan (~ 10%), xyloglucan (~ 10%) and smaller amounts of other polysaccharides. Low yields of specific monosaccharides by some methods may be exaggerated in epidermal walls impregnated with waxes and cutin and call for cautious interpretation of the results. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Pretreatments are commonly used to facilitate the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass to its component sugars and aromatics. Previously, we showed that iron ions can be used as co-catalysts to reduce the severity of dilute acid pretreatment of biomass. Transgenic iron-accumulating Arabidopsis and rice plants exhibited higher iron content in grains, increased biomass yield, and importantly, enhanced sugar release from the biomass. Results: In this study, we used intracellular ferritin (FerIN) alone and in combination with an improved version of cell wall-bound carbohydrate-binding module fused iron-binding peptide (IBPex) specifically targeting switchgrass, a bioenergy crop species. The FerIN switchgrass improved by 15% in height and 65% in yield, whereas the FerIN/IBPex transgenics showed enhancement up to 30% in height and 115% in yield. The FerIN and FerIN/IBPex switchgrass had 27% and 51% higher in planta iron accumulation than the empty vector (EV) control, respectively, under normal growth conditions. Improved pretreatability was observed in FerIN switchgrass (~ 14% more glucose release than the EV), and the FerIN/IBPex plants showed further enhancement in glucose release up to 24%. Conclusions: We conclude that this iron-accumulating strategy can be transferred from model plants and applied to bioenergy crops, such as switchgrass. The intra- and extra-cellular iron incorporation approach improves biomass pretreatability and digestibility, providing upgraded feedstocks for the production of biofuels and bioproducts. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is one of the best producers of cellulase and has been widely studied for the production of cellulosic ethanol and bio-based products. We previously reported that Mn2+ and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) can stimulate cellulase overexpression via Ca2+ bursts and calcium signalling in T. reesei under cellulase-inducing conditions. To further understand the regulatory networks involved in cellulase overexpression in T. reesei, we characterised the Mn2+/DMF-induced calcium signalling pathway involved in the stimulation of cellulase overexpression. Results: We found that Mn2+/DMF stimulation significantly increased the intracellular levels of cAMP in an adenylate cyclase (ACY1)-dependent manner. Deletion of acy1 confirmed that cAMP is crucial for the Mn2+/DMF-stimulated cellulase overexpression in T. reesei. We further revealed that cAMP elevation induces a cytosolic Ca2+ burst, thereby initiating the Ca2+ signal transduction pathway in T. reesei, and that cAMP signalling causes the Ca2+ signalling pathway to regulate cellulase production in T. reesei. Furthermore, using a phospholipase C encoding gene plc-e deletion strain, we showed that the plc-e gene is vital for cellulase overexpression in response to stimulation by both Mn2+ and DMF, and that cAMP induces a Ca2+ burst through PLC-E. Conclusions: The findings of this study reveal the presence of a signal transduction pathway in which Mn2+/DMF stimulation produces cAMP. Increase in the levels of cAMP activates the calcium signalling pathway via phospholipase C to regulate cellulase overexpression under cellulase-inducing conditions. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of the cAMP–PLC–calcium signalling pathway underlying cellulase expression in T. reesei and highlight the potential applications of signal transduction in the regulation of gene expression in fungi. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Heterotrophic single-cell oils (SCOs) are one potential replacement to lipid-derived biofuels sourced from first-generation crops such as palm oil. However, despite a large experimental research effort in this area, there are only a handful of techno-economic modelling publications. As such, there is little understanding of whether SCOs are, or could ever be, a potential competitive replacement. To help address this question, we designed a detailed model that coupled a hypothetical heterotroph (using the very best possible biological lipid production) with the largest and most efficient chemical plant design possible. Results: Our base case gave a lipid selling price of $1.81/kg for ~ 8,000 tonnes/year production, that could be reduced to $1.20/kg on increasing production to ~ 48,000 tonnes of lipid a year. A range of scenarios to further reduce this cost were then assessed, including using a thermotolerant strain (reducing the cost from $1.20 to $1.15/kg), zero-cost electricity ($ 1.12/kg), using non-sterile conditions ($1.19/kg), wet extraction of lipids ($1.16/kg), continuous production of extracellular lipid ($0.99/kg) and selling the whole yeast cell, including recovering value for the protein and carbohydrate ($0.81/kg). If co-products were produced alongside the lipid then the price could be effectively reduced to $0, depending on the amount of carbon funnelled away from lipid production, as long as the co-product could be sold in excess of $1/kg. Conclusions: The model presented here represents an ideal case that which while not achievable in reality, importantly would not be able to be improved on, irrespective of the scientific advances in this area. From the scenarios explored, it is possible to produce lower cost SCOs, but research must start to be applied in three key areas, firstly designing products where the whole cell is used. Secondly, further work on the product systems that produce lipids extracellularly in a continuous processing methodology or finally that create an effective biorefinery designed to produce a low molecular weight, bulk chemical, alongside the lipid. All other research areas will only ever give incremental gains rather than leading towards an economically competitive, sustainable, microbial oil. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Sugar content is critically important in determining sugar crop productivity. However, improvement in sugar content has been stagnant among sugar crops for decades. Sorghum, especially sweet sorghum with high biomass, shown great potential for biofuel, has lower sugar content than sugarcane. To enhance sugar content, the sucrose isomerase (SI) gene, driven by stem-specific promoters (A2 or LSG) with a vacuole-targetted signal peptide, was transformed into the sorghum inbred line (T×430). Results: The study demonstrated that transgenic lines of grain sorghum, containing 50–60% isomaltulose, accumulated up to eightfold (1000 mM) more total sugar than the control T×430 did (118 mM) in stalks of T0 generation. Subsequently, the elite engineered lines (A5, and LSG9) were crossed with sweet sorghum (Rio, and R9188). Total sugar contents (over 750 mM), were notably higher in F1, and F2 progenies than the control Rio (480 mM). The sugar contents of the engineered lines (over 750 mM), including T0, T1, F1, and F2, are surprisingly higher than that of the field-grown sugarcane (normal range 600–700 mmol/L). Additionally, analysis of physiological characterization demonstrated that the superior progenies had notably higher rates of photosynthesis, sucrose transportation, and sink strength than the controls. Conclusions: The genetic engineering approach has dramatically enhanced total sugar content in grain sorghum (T0, and T1) and hybrid sorghum (F1, and F2), demonstrating that sorghum can accumulate as high or higher sugar content than sugarcane. This research illustrates that the SI gene has enormous potential on improvement of sugar content in sorghum, particularly in hybirds and sweet sorghum. The substantial increase on sugar content would lead to significant financial benefits for industrial utilization. This study could have a substantial impact on renewable bioenergy. More importantly, our results demonstrated that the phenotype of high sugar content is inheritable and shed light on improvement for other sugar crops. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: One of the sustainable development goals focuses on the biomass-based production as a replacement for fossil-based commodities. A novel feedstock with vast potentials is tunicate biomass, which can be pretreated and fermented in a similar way to lignocellulose. Ciona intestinalis is a marine filter feeder that is cultivated to produce fish feed. While the inner tissue body is used for feed production, the surrounding tunic remains as a cellulose-rich by-product, which can be further separated into outer and inner tunic. Ethanol production from organosolv-pretreated whole-tunic biomass was recently validated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of organosolv pretreated outer-tunic biomass for the production of biofuels and cellobiose that is a disaccharide with prebiotic potential. Results: As a result, 41.4 g/L of ethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, corresponding to a 90.2% theoretical yield, was achieved under the optimal conditions when the tunicate biomass was pretreated at 195 °C for 60 min at a liquid-to-solid ratio of 50. In addition, cellobiose production by enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated tunicate biomass was demonstrated with a maximum conversion yield of 49.7 wt. %. Conclusions: The utilisation of tunicate biomass offers an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative for value-added biofuels and chemicals. The cultivation of tunicate biomass in shallow coastal sea improves the quality of the water and ensures sustainable production of fish feed. Moreover, there is no competition for arable land, which leaves the latter available for food and feed production. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Humic acids (HA) have been used in biorefinery process due to its surfactant properties as an aid to the pretreatment of lignocellulose, with results indicating a positive effect on delignification. However, the HA remaining on the surface of the pretreated lignocellulose has also been shown to provide a negative effect on ensuing enzymatic digestibility. Hence, a strategy of complexing metallic cations with HA prior to enzymatic hydrolysis was proposed and demonstrated in this work in an effort to provide a means of HA mitigation that does not involve significant water consumption via extensive washing. Results: Results showed that the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of waste wheat straw decreased from 81.9% to 66.1% when it was pretreated by 10 g/L HA, attributed to the inhibition ability of the residual HA on enzyme activity of cellulase with a debasement of 36.3%. Interestingly, enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency could be increased from 66.1% to 77.3% when 10 mM Fe3+ was introduced to the system and allowed to associate with HA during saccharification. Conclusions: The addition of high-priced metallic cations (Fe3+) has successfully alleviated the effect of HA on cellulase activity. It is our hope in demonstrating the complexation affinity between metallic cations and HA, future researchers and biorefinery developers will evaluate this strategy as a unit operation that could allow economic biorefining of WWS to produce valuable biochemicals, biofuels, and biomaterials. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The discovery of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) has fundamentally changed our understanding of microbial lignocellulose degradation. Cellulomonas bacteria have a rich history of study due to their ability to degrade recalcitrant cellulose, yet little is known about the predicted LPMOs that they encode from Auxiliary Activity Family 10 (AA10). Results: Here, we present the comprehensive biochemical characterization of three AA10 LPMOs from Cellulomonas flavigena (CflaLPMO10A, CflaLPMO10B, and CflaLPMO10C) and one LPMO from Cellulomonas fimi (CfiLPMO10). We demonstrate that these four enzymes oxidize insoluble cellulose with C1 regioselectivity and show a preference for substrates with high surface area. In addition, CflaLPMO10B, CflaLPMO10C, and CfiLPMO10 exhibit limited capacity to perform mixed C1/C4 regioselective oxidative cleavage. Thermostability analysis indicates that these LPMOs can refold spontaneously following denaturation dependent on the presence of copper coordination. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed substrate-specific surface and structural morphological changes following LPMO action on Avicel and phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose (PASC). Further, we demonstrate that the LPMOs encoded by Cellulomonas flavigena exhibit synergy in cellulose degradation, which is due in part to decreased autoinactivation. Conclusions: Together, these results advance understanding of the cellulose utilization machinery of historically important Cellulomonas species beyond hydrolytic enzymes to include lytic cleavage. This work also contributes to the broader mapping of enzyme activity in Auxiliary Activity Family 10 and provides new biocatalysts for potential applications in biomass modification. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Consolidated bioprocessing using oleaginous yeast is a promising modality for the economic conversion of plant biomass to fuels and chemicals. However, yeast are not known to produce effective biomass degrading enzymes naturally and this trait is essential for efficient consolidated bioprocessing. We expressed a chimeric cellobiohydrolase I gene in three different oleaginous, industrially relevant yeast: Yarrowia lipolytica, Lipomyces starkeyi, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the biochemical and catalytic properties and biomass deconstruction potential of these recombinant enzymes. Our results showed differences in glycosylation, surface charge, thermal and proteolytic stability, and efficacy of biomass digestion. L. starkeyi was shown to be an inferior active cellulase producer compared to both the Y. lipolytica and S. cerevisiae enzymes, whereas the cellulase expressed in S. cerevisiae displayed the lowest activity against dilute-acid-pretreated corn stover. Comparatively, the chimeric cellobiohydrolase I enzyme expressed in Y. lipolytica was found to have a lower extent of glycosylation, better protease stability, and higher activity against dilute-acid-pretreated corn stover. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Lignocellulose-based biofuels are of major importance to mitigate the impact of international traffic and transport on climate change while sustaining agricultural land for food supply. Highly integrated systems like consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), where enzyme production, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of the released sugars are carried out in one reactor, offer the highest potential to save costs and to make lignocellulose-based biofuels economically competitive. The work described here showed that CBP based on a microbial consortium operated at full-scale (2000 t/d) saves up to 27.5 % of the total ethanol production costs compared to conventional ethanol production from lignocellulose in individual process steps. The cost savings are mainly achieved through lower CAPEX due to less apparatus requirements because of the integrated process, as well as through lower OPEX since no glucose is needed for enzyme production. A comparison with literature estimations of cost savings of CBP based on genetically modified microorganisms results in approximately the same range. As a result of a detailed sensitivity analysis, scale and yield were identified as the main cost-pushers from a process point of view, whereas the price level of the plant location has the highest impact on the investment conditions. In the EU, CBP yields enough margin for profitable production and the possibility to decentralize biomass valorization, whereas in the world's largest ethanol market, the U.S, profitable production of lignocellulosic ethanol can only be achieved by CBP combined with other cost saving techniques, such as utilization of cost-free waste feedstocks, since ethanol has undergone a considerable price slump. © 2021

AB  - Microalgae are recognized as potential candidates for resource recovery from wastewater and projected for biorefinery models. This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of poultry litter and municipal wastewater as nutrient and water sources, for the cultivation of Acutodesmus obliquus for lipids production for biodiesel application. The efficacy of lipid extracted biomass (LEA) as fertilizer for mung bean crops was also assessed in microcosm. A. obliquus cultivation in acid pre-treated poultry litter extract (PPLE) showed maximum biomass production of 1.90 g L−1, which was 74.67% and 12.61% higher than the raw poultry litter extract (RPPE) and BG11 respectively. Higher NO3-N, NH3-N, and PO4-P removal of 79.51%, 81.82%, and 80.52% respectively were observed in PPLE as compared to RPLE treatment. The highest biomass (140.36 mg L−1 d−1), lipids (38.49 mg L−1 d−1), and carbohydrates (49.55 mg L−1 d−1) productivities were observed in the PPLE medium. The application of LEA as a fertilizer for mung bean crops showed improvement in plant growth and soil microbial activity. A maximum increase in organic carbon (59.5%) and dehydrogenase activity (130.8%) was observed in LEA amended soil which was significantly higher than chemical fertilizer (CF) control in 30 days. Whilst plant fresh weight and leaf chlorophyll in the LEA amended soil was comparable to whole algal biomass (WA) and CF control. The strategy developed could be a basis for sustainable biorefinery for the valorization of wastewater for the production of microalgae-derived biofuel and byproducts for agricultural application. © 2021

AB  - Lignocellulosic energy crops are promising feedstocks for producing renewable fuels, such as methane, that can replace diminishing fossil fuels. However, there is a major handicap in using lignocellulosic sources to produce biofuels, which is their low biodegradability. In this study, the application and the optimization of a lignocellulose pretreatment process, named alkaline hydrogen peroxide, was investigated for the enhancement of methane production from the energy crop switchgrass. Four independent process variables, solid content (3–7%), reaction temperature (50–100 °C), H2O2 concentration (1–3%), and reaction time (6–24 h), and three response variables, soluble reducing sugar, soluble chemical oxygen demand, and biochemical methane potential were used in process optimization and modeling. The optimization was performed by two different approaches as maximum methane production and cost minimization. The optimum conditions for the highest methane production were found as 6.65 wt% solid content, 50.6 °C reaction temperature, 2.94 wt% H2O2 concentration, and 16.05 h reaction time. The conditions providing the lowest cost were 6.43 wt% solid content, 50 °C reaction temperature, 1.83 wt% H2O2 concentration, and 6.78 h reaction time. For maximum methane production and cost minimization, specific methane yields of 338.52 mL CH4/g VS and 291.34 mL CH4/g VS were predicted with 62.4 % and 39.8 % enhancements compared to untreated switchgrass, respectively. Finally, it was found that the predicted methane production for the maximum methane production represents 77 % of the theoretical methane yield and 82.22 % energy recovery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing population and industrialization caused increased demand for liquid fossil fuels which in turn increases the greenhouse gas emission. Bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic biomass via enzymatic route is a potential alternative to fossil fuels and is environmentally sustainable. Cellulases have been regarded as the limiting factor for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass via enzymes. In the last few decades advances in bioprocesses led to reduction in the cost of cellulases by several folds, enabling bioethanol production to become cost-effective. This is the reason for existence of commercial plants for bioethanol production, however; still there are scope for further improvement in bioprocess for cellulase production and research is ongoing worldwide. Researchers face huge challenge while moving from flask and bioreactor research outcomes from a laboratory scale to the pilot scale production, which has been rarely discussed. This review will present those challenges and its probable solutions. Though commercial cellulases are available, it is highly required to have in-house cellulase production technology to be self-reliant. On-site and integrated cellulase production configuration is popular as it seems to be cost-effective. This review will address advances in bioprocesses and challenges for cellulase production which have surfaced in the last decade. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chlorella, unicellular green algae, has been spotlighted not only as a model organism but also as a cell factory for various metabolites, biofuels and biopharmaceuticals. In order to accelerate the use Chlorella as a future biopharmaceutical platform, secretomes and the N-glycosylation of the secreted proteins were analyzed from Chlorella vulgaris UTEX395 and an arctic Chlorella species ArM0029B. From liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, 428 and 56 extracellular proteins from the culture of UTEX395 and ArM0029B, respectively, were analyzed. Most of the secretomes are related to metabolic processes including enzymes of carbonic anhydrases, chitinases, phosphatases and oxidases. Some of secretomes are related to extracellular fatty acid metabolic process and cell wall proteins giving clues for unknown Chlorella cell wall structure. Both N-glycans of the secreted proteins showed methylated oligomannosidic structure, but ArM0029B N-glycans showed pauci mannose with pentose and methylation. In silico analysis based on the N-glycan structures provided putative N-glycosylation pathways in both strains. We believe that the findings in this study extend our knowledge of Chlorella and evolutionary process of land plants. Moreover, it would contribute to the development of biotechnological application of Chlorella. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Panicum maximum represents an alternative as a dedicated energy crop for biorefinery. However, both pretreatment step and climate conditions impact its chemical composition and possibly its hydrolytic performance. Therefore, this study looks into integrating the future effect of the climate conditions and the pretreatment methods on the hydrolytic performance of P. maximum. Through a Trop-T-FACE system, P. maximum grown under three hypothetical future climate conditions: elevated temperature ((eT), which is 2 °C more than the ambient canopy temperature), elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ((eC) up to 600 μmol mol-1) and the combined effects (eT + eC). Subsequently, the groups were subjected to the liquid hot water (LHW) and organosolv (ORG) pretreatments, which enhanced biomass digestibility by mostly hemicellulose and lignin removal, respectively. Furthermore, optimized hydrolysis and fluorescent protein-tagged carbohydrate-binding modules binding suggested that P. maximum pretreated by LHW has greater saccharification yields and higher cellulose surface accessibility/exposure. This shows that hemicellulose directly impacts P. maximum recalcitrance, and its removal was the optimum pretreatment strategy. Concerning the studied expected future climate conditions, LHW samples did not show significant differences in hydrolysis yields at low solids loading (2%). However, at 10 % solids, eC had higher conversion yields (likely due to minimum end-product inhibition). Similarly, for organosolv pretreated samples, eC (at 2 and 10 % solid loading) exhibited greater cellulose-glucan conversion yields among the climate conditions groups and the highest cellulose accessibility. Thus, this work contributes to understand better the influence of both studied pretreatment methods and future climate conditions on the conversion efficiency of a critical energy crop and might assist in selecting the best pretreatment method to mitigate the climate effects and achieve greater hydrolysis yields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agave bagasse (AB), a byproduct of tequila production, is a waste generated in large quantities and an emerging alternative for biofuels production. Nevertheless, the use of lignocellulosic biomass for this purpose requires a pretreatment that maximizes its degradation and utilization. Although there are several pretreatment types, using ionic liquids (IL) has become attractive due to its ability to dissolve the lignocellulosic biomass under mild conditions of time and temperature. As a drawback are the high cost of IL's and their high viscosity; thus mixing them with water is a way to overcome these hindrances. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with three diluted ILs on the A. tequilana bagasse structure and sugars production, as well as the potential of the enzymatic hydrolysate to produce methane in batch mode. The evaluated ILs were: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [Emim][OAc], choline lysinate [Ch][Lys] and ethanolamine acetate [EOA][OAc]. The results showed that the IL with the best performance was [Ch][Lys], which not only offered the highest yields of sugar production (0.57 ± 0.03 g total sugars / g bagasse) but also, it is possible to use it at 30 % in a mix with water obtaining similar yields as with pure IL. Enzymatic hydrolysis of IL pretreated AB achieved 50.7 kg sugars and 49.3 kg of sugars for 90 %-[Ch][Lys] and 30 %-[Ch][Lys], respectively per 100 kg of untreated biomass. The enzymatic hydrolysate from the 30 %-[Ch][Lys] pretreated AB was able to achieve 0.28 L CH4/g CODfed, demonstrating that both sugar and methane yields are maintained when pure or 30 %-[Ch][Lys] are used for pretreatment, representing a step forward towards process feasibility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the pyrolysis of mustard straw (MS) in a thermogravimetric analyser and in a tubular reactor to recognize its bioenergy capability. The model free methods of Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Vyazovkin were employed for kinetic analysis and Coats-Redfern (CR) method for elucidating the reaction mechanism. Response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design technique was employed to optimize the pyrolysis process parameters to gain maximum amount of bio-oil. The highest bio-oil yield (44.69%) was obtained at the heating rate of 25 °C/min and at 500 °C under inert condition (N2 gas flow rate = 100 ml/min). Further, FTIR and GCMS analysis of bio-oil revealed the presence of different functional groups and valuable chemicals, whereas physicochemical characterization revealed its fuel characteristic. The results confirmed the suitability of mustard straw as a feed-stock for obtaining a cleaner fuel and value added products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work was the first time to evaluate the ability of an isolated Chlorella vulgaris MBFJNU-1 to remove nutrients of original swine wastewater (OSW) and fix carbon dioxide (CO2) under outdoor conditions in a simultaneous manner using column photobioreactors. The results showed that microalga cultivated at 3% CO2 in a batch mode achieved the highest biomass and CO2 fixation rate. Then, a semi-continuous process for OSW treatment and CO2 fixation simultaneously by microalga was established and the renewal rate of this process was deeply investigated. Microalga cultivated at 3% CO2 and 80% renewal rate gave the highest productivities of total biomass, CO2 fixation and the greatest average removal rates of total nitrogen, N-NH4+, total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand. Taken together, C. vulgaris MBFJNU-1 was the promising microalga under outdoor conditions for swine wastewater treatment and CO2 fixation simultaneously for biofuels and biofertilizer production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mariculture wastewater has drawn growing attention due to associated threats for coastal environment. However, most biological techniques exhibit unfavorable performance due to saline inhibition. Furthermore, only NaCl was used in most studies causing clumsy evaluation, undermining the potential of microalgal mariculture wastewater treatment. Herein, various concentrations of NaCl and sea salt are comprehensively examined and compared for their efficiencies of mariculture wastewater treatment and biodiesel conversion. The results indicate sea salt is a better trigger for treating wastewater (nearly 100% total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal) and producing high-quality biodiesel (330 mg/L•d). Structure equation model (SEM) further demonstrates the correlation of wastewater treatment performance and microalgal status is gradually weakened with increment of sea salt concentrations. Furthermore, metabolic analysis reveals enhanced photosynthesis might be the pivotal motivator for preferable outcomes under sea salt stimulation. This study provides new insights into microalgae-based approach integrating mariculture wastewater treatment and biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The commercial feasibility of energy-efficient conversion of highly concentrated microalgal suspensions to produce high-titer biofuels is a major bottleneck due to high energy consumption. Herein, high-titer biofuels (bioethanol, higher-alcohols, and biodiesel) were generated from carbohydrate-rich Chlamydomonas mexicana and lipid-rich Chlamydomonas pitschmannii biomass through energy-saving microwave pretreatment, successive fermentation, and transesterification. Microwave pretreatment needed low specific energy (4.2 MJ/kg) for 100 g/L of microalgal suspension. Proposed sustainable integrated pretreatments method achieved unprecedented total conversion efficiency (67%) and highest biomass utilization (87%) of C. pitschmannii (100 g/L) with high yields of bioethanol (0.48 g-ethanol/g-carbohydrates), higher-alcohols (0.44 g-higher-alcohols/g-proteins), and biodiesel (0.90 g-biodiesel/g-lipids). Transmission electron microscopy showed the changes in the microalgal cellular integrity before and after sequential fermentations. Energy-efficient integrated pretreatments enhanced the extraction efficiency and whole utilization of high-concentration microalgae to generate high-titer biofuels with minimum waste production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study extracts and enriches cellulolytic microbial consortia from yak (Bos grunniens) and evaluates their effects on the fermentation profile and bioethanol yield in rice straw silage. Two microbial consortia (CF and PY) with high cellulolytic activity were isolated and observed to be prone to utilize natural carbon sources. Two consortia were introduced with and without combined lactic acid bacteria (CLAB) to rice straw for up to 60 days of ensiling, and their application notably decreased the levels of structural carbohydrates and pH values of rice straw silages. Treatments that combining microbial consortia and CLAB resulted in the highest levels of lactic acid, water soluble carbohydrates, mono- and disaccharides, and lignocellulose degradation, with PY + CLAB group yielding the highest bioethanol production. The microbial consortia identified herein exhibit great potential for degrading fibrous substrates, and their combination with CLAB provides a feasible way to efficiently use rice straw for bioethanol production. © 2021

AB  - The fossil fuel utilization adversely affected the environmental health due to the rising emission levels of greenhouse gases. Consequently, the challenges of climate change loaded great stress on renewable energy sources. It is noted that extreme consumption of fossil fuels increased the earth temperature by 1.9 °C that adversely influenced the life and biodiversity. Biorefinery is the sustainable process for the production of biofuels and other bio-products from biomass feedstock using different conversion technologies. Biofuel is an important component of renewable energy sources contributing to overall carbon-neutral energy system. Studies reported that on global scale, over 90% of petroleum goods could be produced from renewable resources by 2023, whereas, 33% chemicals, and 50% of the pharmaceutical market share is also expected to be bio-based. This study details the brief review of operation, development, application, limitations, future perspectives, circular bioeconomy, and life cycle assessment of biorefinery. The economic and environmental aspects of biofuels and biorefineries are briefly discussed. Lastly, considering the present challenges, the future perspectives of biofuels and biorefineries are highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass results in the formation of bio-oil, aqueous phase (HTL-AP), bio-char, and gaseous products. Safer disposal of HTL-AP is difficult on an industrial scale since it comprises low molecular acid compounds. This review provides a comprehensive note on the recent articles published on the effective usage of HTL-AP for the recovery of valuable compounds. Thermo-chemical and biological processes are the preferred techniques for the recovery of biofuel, platform chemicals from HTL-AP. From this review, it was evident that the composition of HTL-AP and product recovery are the integrated pathways, which depend on each other. Substitute as reaction medium in HTL process, growth medium for algae and microbes are the most common mode of reuse and recycle of HTL-AP. Future research is needed to depict the mechanism of HTL process when HTL-AP is used as a reaction medium on an industrial scale. Need to find a solution for the hindrance in commercializing HTL process and recovery of value-added compounds from HTL-AP from lab scale to industry level. Integrated pathways on reuse and HTL-AP recycle helps in reduced environmental concerns and sustainable production of bio-products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, a suitable pretreatment based on an acidic ionic liquid was employed for superior enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw, which is regarded as an inexpensive, easily accessible, and renewable agricultural waste. Using 1-(carboxymethyl)pyridinium chloride as an acidic ionic liquid, containing, both acetate and chloride groups, a superior penetration between cellulose chains and a proper dissolution can be easily achieved. Different analyzes, including FT-IR, XRD, and SEM, were conducted, indicating restructuring and increased free volume between cellulose chains in rice straw. Following the proper pretreatment with the ionic liquid, the next step in the fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis process was well conducted, and promising results were attained for biofuel productions. The effects of water as a co-solvent, pretreatment time (2, 3, 5 h), temperature (25, 90, 120 °C), and solid loading (5, 6, 15% w/w) were investigated for maximum ethanol production. The best results were obtained in 35% water, at room temperature, and 6% (w/w) solid loading for 3 h. The hydrolysis yield in ethanol production was improved to 62.2% of the theoretical maximum. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tetraselmis sp. strain MD-01, a microalga isolated from the Tunisian marine coast, has been studied for autotrophic lipids production with two stage process. This strategy was conducted for maximum cells production under moderated conditions (2.12 g L−1), followed by cultivation under stressed conditions to induce lipid synthesis. High irradiance (300 μmol m−2 s−1) and nitrogen depletion (S mode) showed better carotenoids accumulation and lower chlorophylls content in microalgae compared to those obtained in biomass cultivated under high irradiance (Sg mode). This two-stage strategy allowed to increase of lipid content in cells cultivated in Sg and S modes from 18% DW (stage I) to 50 and 61.5% DW (stage II), respectively, with an increase of saturated and long chain fatty acids levels. Based on fluorometry analyses, an increase of lipids in Nile-Red stained cells and a decrease of chlorophylls auto-fluorescence under stressed conditions were shown. From spectral data, the lipids: amide I ratio obtained from S mode was 2.17 and 4.45 times higher than that from Sg mode and control conditions, respectively. These results revealed the potential of Tetraselmis strain MD-01 for biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work aimed the application of a new biocatalyst for biodiesel production from residual agro-industrial fatty acids. A recombinant Pichia pastoris displaying lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (RML) on the cell surface, using the PIR-1 anchor system, were prepared using glycerol as the carbon source. The biocatalyst, named RML-PIR1 showed optimum temperature of 45 °C (74.0 U/L). The stability tests resulted in t1/2 of 3.49 and 2.15 h at 40 and 45 °C, respectively. RML-PIR1 was applied in esterification reactions using industrial co-products as substrates, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and soybean fatty acid distillate (SFAD). The highest productivity was observed for SFAD after 48 h presenting 79.1% of conversion using only 10% of biocatalyst and free-solvent system. This is about ca. eight times higher than commercial free RML in the same conditions. The stabilizing agents study revealed that the treatment using glutaraldehyde (GA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) enabled increased stability and reuse of biocatalyst. It was observed by SEM analysis that the treatment modified the cell morphology. RML-PIR1-GA presented 87.9% of the initial activity after 6 reuses, whilst the activity of unmodified RML-PIR decreased by 40% after the first use. These results were superior to those obtained in the literature, making this new biocatalyst promising for biotechnological applications, such as the production of biofuels on a large scale. © 2021

AB  - Sustainable power generation for portable electronic devices is of high interest due to increasing energy demands. Miniaturized biofuel cells are well-reported for this purpose where ubiquitous fluids, like glucose or lactate, can be leveraged. However, such biofuel cells need enzymes to complete the catalysis, leading to many prevalent issues like the longevity of enzymes, complicated immobilization, additional mediators etc. Therefore, non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cells (NEGBFCs) are gaining interest due to their cost-effectiveness, high repeatability and excellent stability. However, based on our best knowledge such glucose biofuel cells are not reported in microfluidic environment, and therefore their potential is not exploited. Realization of the functionality of such NEGBFCs in a microscale is crucial to replace them with their enzymatic counterparts. In this work, for the first time, a microfluidic non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (μNEGBFC) is developed on a paper-based platform using metallic catalysts. The catalysts for electrocatalytic energy generation is fabricated using electrodeposition method and their detailed physicochemical characterizations are done. The μNEGBFC is capable of producing a power density of 12.5 μW/cm2 with a stable potential of 410 mV. This green power output can be used to operate low-power micro-devices and lab-on-chip sensors in a more continual and viable manner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Our study analyzed if it could be possible for converting hydrochar from food waste and its ash into solid biofuels and adsorbents of CO2. The pilot-scale manufacturing of pellets consisted of carbonizing food waste at 200.00 °C and 1.50 MPa for 1.00–2.00 h then pressing its hydrochar and ash with spent coffee ground on an automatic pelletizer at 75.00–100.00 MPa and 150.00 °C for 90.00 s. Products with co-addition were highly durable (97.95–98.05%), burned themselves out stably with 2.75–3.25 W g−1 heat flow and tended to have low slagging, despite their significant amount of ash of 2.80–2.90%. Hypothetically, they replaced approximately 10.00% of generation of electricity and saved 112.20 × 106 Mg yr−1 emission of CO2 from coal. Our insights are timely and absolutely will assist with tackling social and environmental impacts of generation of hazardous (bio)waste and emission of CO2 from coal-like fossil fuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conifer oleoresin is a highly precious raw material for industrial sectors and a precursor for biofuels. Diterpenoid, particularly diterpenoid resin acids (DRAs), is one of the most abundant oleoresin components. Masson pine (Pinus massoniana L.) is one of the most important native species for oleoresin yield in China. To better understand the biosynthesis of diterpenoid in high oleoresin-yield masson pine and develop methods for its production in needle and trunk xylem, we used the combination of SMRT full-length transcriptome and Illumina RNA sequencing technologies to establish a transcriptome dataset. Approximately 20,560 and 17,950 full-length non-redundant transcripts were assembled in trunk xylem and needle, respectively. Of those, 29 and 20 DEGs were identified involving in the Terpenoid Backbone Biosynthesis pathway (TBB) (KO 00900) and the Diterpenoid Biosynthesis pathway (DB) (KO 00904) in trunk xylem, as well as 35 and 12 DEGs in the TBB and the DB in the needle, respectively. Compared with the low oleoresin-yield germplasm, 13 up-regulated DEGs with complete open reading frame (ORF) sequence were obtained by Venn analysis in trunk xylem and needle of a high oleoresin-yield clone. Subsequently, the expression patterns of the 16 diterpenoid biosynthesis-related genes (including three types of DXS genes) were validated by quantitative real-time PCR in both 12-year-old and 1-year-old high and low oleoresin-yield masson pine clones. The results showed that the 13 genes in the higher yield oleoresin trees were proved to be higher expression in comparison with the lower ones irrespectively of the tree age; as well as MCS (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2, 4-cyclodiphosphate synthase), HDS (1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl4-diphosphate synthase), and IDI (Isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase) of the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway demonstrated a higher expression compared to that of other TBB genes. Both cytosol-localized MVA and plastid-localized MEP pathways gave significant contributions to diterpenoid accumulation, and the latter played a more dominant role. To clarify the potential relationships between oleoresin yield and the expression patterns of 16 genes from the TBB and DB pathways, the Pearson correlation analysis was performed using three tissues (young needle, old needle, and trunk xylem) from the 60-year-old tree. Remarkably, HMGR (Hydroxy methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) and ent-CDS (Ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase) were positive correlation with oleoresin yield in the new needle, whereas FPPS (Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase) was a negative correlation with that in the old needle; furthermore, HMGS (Hydroxy methylglutaryl-CoA synthase), IDI and CDS (Copalyl diphosphate synthase) were positively correlated with oleoresin synthesis in the trunk xylem. Moreover, the Pearson correlation analysis was also carried out to determine the potential relationships between the 13 genes of the TBB pathways and ent-CDS, CDS, and LDS ((13E)-labda-7 13-dien-15-ol synthase) from DB pathways within three tissues of the 60-year-old masson pine. Furthermore, the diterpenoid and diterpene resin acids (DRAs) demonstrated highly positive correlations with oleoresin yield, and DRAs were detected as the most abundant diterpenoids in oleoresin. Promisingly, HMGR, MCS, HDS, IDI, ent-CDS, and CDS may be used as the key target genes of the molecular-assisted selection for high-oleoresin-yielding germplasm in this species. © 2021

AB  - Corn fiber is a byproduct of wet milling of corn grains with high hemicellulose content. Hemicellulose is only partially hydrolyzed in acid pretreatment and the complete hydrolysis occurs in the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. In the regular biorefinery chain of lignocellulose, the detoxification of toxic inhibitors is conducted immediately after pretreatment. When this process arrangement applies to corn fiber, acetic acid is accumulated to high level because of acetyl group release from residual hemicellulose. This study re-framed the biorefinery chain by conducting enzymatic hydrolysis before biodetoxification to completely release acetic acid from hemicellulose in corn fiber. Then the biodetoxification was followed immediately to degrade acetic acid, furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural with the minimum loss of glucose and xylose. The improved ethanol production (70.2 g/L, or 8.9 % by v/v) was obtained by the re-framed chain of corn fiber biorefining. This study provided a practical approach for utilization of corn fiber for biofuel production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid industrialization and population growth have resulted in the wastage of significant quantity of food globally throughout the value chain right from harvesting to storage, processing and consumption. Normally, these waste materials are allowed to decay in the natural process or burnt to recover a part of the energy in the thermal form, leading to environmental pollution and loss of value. There is an imperative need to realize that food waste is a bundle of energy, which requires carefully planned recovery without damaging the environment. Conversion of food waste to bio-based liquid or gaseous fuels appears to be an attractive option to meet the escalating demand for fuel and at the same time slowing down the fast-depleting fossil fuel resources. In this context, it is felt appropriate to review the current status of the available technologies which are used in the disposal of food waste in order to identify the variables for process intensification to convert them to fuel keeping in mind the environmental concerns and logistics of utilization. The technologies including incineration, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and biochemical methods have been assessed alongside the recent developing technologies such as hydrothermal carbonization and supercritical water gasification. The critical evaluations of these technologies have been made based on the concepts of life cycle analysis, multi-objective optimization and circular bio-economics which help in assessing the environmental impact. Finally, safety aspects and the way forward are highlighted for future work. This article could form a promising path towards a holistic assessment of efficient food waste to energy conversion for a sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, eco-friendly and disposable paper-based membraneless microfluidic enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) were developed without any mediators to reduce the toxicity and cost of EFCs. Glucose oxidase and laccase were immobilized on multi-walled carbon nanotube electrodes to catalyze the redox reaction of glucose and oxygen. Micromachining techniques well-suited for mass production were used to precisely fabricate micro-scale Y-shaped and cross-shaped EFCs. Experimental measurements showed that the concentration of glucose in the fuel solution affects the cell performance, which occurs because the flow speed of the fuel stream decreases as the concentration of glucose increases. The highest performance of power density (104.2 ± 3.35 μW cm−2) and current density (615.6 ± 3.14 μA cm−2) were obtained with the Y-shaped channel configuration at a glucose concentration of 100 mM. This performance is the best of all paper-based single EFCs reported to date. The new paper-based co-laminar flow mediatorless EFC exhibits strong potential to power miniaturized and portable on-site diagnostic devices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Third generation biomass (marine macroalgae) has been projected as a promising alternative energy resource for bioethanol production due to its high carbon and no lignin composition. However, the major challenge in the technologies of production lies in the fermentative bioconversion process. Therefore, in the present study the predictive ability of an integrated artificial neural network with genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) in the modelling of bioethanol production was investigated for an indigenous marine macroalgal biomass (Ulva prolifera) by a novel yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae NFCCI1248 using six fermentative parameters, viz., substrate concentration, fermentation time, inoculum size, temperature, agitation speed and pH. The experimental model was developed using one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) method to analyze the effects of the fermentative parameters on bioethanol production and the obtained regression equation was used as a fitness function for the ANN-GA modelling. The ANN-GA model predicted a maximum bioethanol production at 30 g/L substrate, 48 h fermentation time, 10% (v/v) inoculum, 30 °C temperature, 50 rpm agitation speed and pH 6. The maximum experimental bioethanol yield obtained after applying ANN-GA was 0.242 ± 0.002 g/g RS, which was in close proximity with the predicted value (0.239 g/g RS). Hence, the developed ANN-GA model can be applied as an efficient approach for predicting the fermentative bioethanol production from macroalgal biomass. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The sulfomethylation-aided phosphoric acid pretreatment (SPAP) was investigated for bamboo biorefinery. The yield of glucose and xylose were increased from 19.8 % and 13.88 % for H3PO4-pretreated D. sinicus alone (PAP-DS) to 89.06 % and 72.92 % for SPAP-DS. Ethanol concentration for SPAP-DS was 13.26 g/L, which improved by about 3-folds than PAP-DS. The SPAP-DS exhibited the lower lignin content and cellulose crystallinity, thus resulting in the enzyme accessibility to cellulose increased remarkably. The pre-step of sulfomethylation loosened compact structure of bamboo, which significantly contributed to the decrystallization of cellulose in the following H3PO4-pretreatment. The study has potential implications in biomass pretreatments, which should target synergistically and simultaneously toward cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin fraction for obtaining higher bio-based chemical compounds and biofuels. © 2021

AB  - Oleaginous microalgae have emerged as the promising feedstock for biofuels due to their various advantageous features over terrestrial plants. However, the microalgal fuel industry is still in its infancy due to the unavailability of robust algal strains with enhanced lipid content and biomass and economically feasible oil extraction strategies. Microalgal metabolic engineering shows the great potential to enhance lipid accumulation without impairing cell growth by targeted control of key metabolic nodes. Despite the recent advancements in synthetic biology, genetic improvement of microalgae without hindered cellular biomass remains an untapped tool for large-scale biofuel production. In this review, we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of various metabolic engineering strategies for lipid enhancement and the necessity of designing the appropriate strategy for scale-up processes. We have emphasized the need of streamlining the engineering strategies with the aid of recent advancements in DNA manipulation techniques to obviate the existing biological intricacies in lipogenesis. We outline the significance of recruiting potential engineering strategies such as transcription engineering, heterologous recombineering, and genome engineering to generate chassis algal strains successfully. Besides, this review highlights the designing of modular strategies by subjecting the engineered strains under sub-optimal conditions, mixotrophic cultivations and chemical treatment to overcome the existing bottlenecks in microalgal commercialization. This review also discusses the current large-scale algal cultivation units and the drawbacks. Overall, this review provides insights into employing the metabolic rewiring strategies to engineer the intricate lipogenic circuit in microalgae for enhancing biofuel potential. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In view of the global energy crisis and climate change, elephant grass (Cenchrus purpureus (Schumach.) Morrone syn. Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.) represents a useful lignocellulosic biofuel feed stock due to its high biomass yield and persistence. Internode elongation is an important factor that affects the productivity of energy grass. Elucidating the molecular mechanism governing internode elongation may facilitate the development of molecular improvement strategies for energy grass, but this mechanism has not been thoroughly investigated in elephant grass to date. In this study, the phenotypic evaluation of six cultivars of elephant grass showed that the plant height positively correlated with internode length, rather than internode number. The dwarf cultivar C. purpureus cv. Mott (CpMott) and the tall cultivar C. purpureus cv. GuiMinYin (CpGMY) exhibited significantly different plant height and internode length but not internode number. Analyses of transcription profiles and gibberellin concentrations from the shoot tips of the two cultivars showed that the endogenous bioactive gibberellin A1 (GA1) concentrations was markedly decreased whilst some of representative gibberellin biosynthetic enzymes were downregulated in the CpMott, such as GA20-oxidase (GA20ox) and ent-kaurene synthase (KS). Exogenous application of gibberellin A3 (GA3) indicated that CpMott is a gibberellin-sensitive dwarf cultivar. In addition, the gibberellin-deficiency of CpMott reduced the lignin content by inhibiting the transcript levels enzyme genes in lignin biosynthesis, while induced the expression levels of genes related to abiotic stress. Overall, our results may serve to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying elephant grass internode elongation and facilitate the development of thus grass into a more efficient energy source. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The quest for an alternative sustainable source without petroleum technology and its refining has prompted the development of biofuels, such as biodiesel, from the transesterification of new or utilized vegetable oil. This work is devoted to the investigation of the transesterification of a used vegetable oil and optimization of the various parameters influencing the synthesis of biodiesel, such as the molar proportion (alcohol/oil), the amount of catalyst added and their weight percentage, the type of alcohol, the temperature T(°C) and the reaction time. From this standpoint, the current work's significant target is to propel the preliminary conditions of the transesterification response of fatty oils to create biodiesel from utilized vegetable oils. Diverse physicochemical characteristics were investigated (in terms of density, viscosity, acidity index, pour point, and flash point) to obtain biodiesel accordingly with international standards and commercial biodiesel. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays are widely used to assess feedsocks in oder to control the process of biogas production. However, the continuous evaluation of feedstocks using a BMP assay is expensive, time-consuming and challenging. In this study, Fourier transform mid-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) was used to predict the BMP values of 87 urban organic waste (UOW) samples derived from different sources in Denmark. The developed model of BMP prediction showed a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.86 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 59.3 mL CH4/g VS in prediction. The interpretation of the regression coefficients used in the calibration showed a positive correlation with BMP for relatively easily degradable compounds, such as aliphatics, most likely lipids and amides most likely in proteins, while a negative correlation was found with lignin and hemicellulose. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fusel oil, a by-product of bioethanol production, can be considered as a low-value and renewable material for transforming into value-added products. In this work, the catalytic cracking of fusel oil was studied in a fixed bed reactor to produce light olefins. The operating parameters, such as the temperature, feed flow rate of fusel oil, feedstock, and the co-feeding water, were investigated over a HZSM-5 catalyst in terms of the yields and distribution of the gaseous products. The highest total carbon in the gaseous products with excellent ethylene and propylene selectivity (44.7%, 34.4%, and 28.6%, respectively) were obtained at 550 °C, a feed flow rate of 0.04 mL/min, and 0.02 g of catalyst. After a long time on stream (TOS), the stability of HZSM-5 was slightly decreased due mainly to coke deposition. Thus, the catalytic cracking of fusel oil shows the ability to be converted into light olefins. However, catalyst improvement to enhance the catalytic activity and stability is still required, at the same time, the technical process with economic feasibility still needs more development in order to be realistically useable on an industrial scale in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Glucose-tolerant and/or glucose-stimulated β-glucosidase is of great interest for its industrial utilization in enzymatic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production. In this study, a new gene of β-glucosidase MaGlu1A was cloned from an alginate-degrading marine bacterium Microbulbifer sp. ALW1. The gene of MaGlu1A encoded a 472-amino acid protein classified into the glycosyl hydrolase family 1 (GH1). The recombinant β-glucosidase was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli with a molecular mass of 65.0 kDa. Structure analysis illustrated the catalytic acid/base residue Glu186 and nucleophilic residue Glu370 in the enzyme. MaGlu1A displayed optimal activity at 40 °C and pH 4.5, respectively. It had substrate preference to the aryl-β-glycosidic bonds with glucose, fucose, and galactose moieties, in addition to cellobiose. MaGlu1A demonstrated strong stimulation to the supplemental glucose. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested an essential role of Asn242 in glucose stimulation. The enzymatic characterization of MaGlu1A provides general information about its catalytic properties facilitating its practical applications. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Macroalgal blooms are increasing globally as a result of anthropogenic stressors and are leading to negative environmental and socio-economic impacts. There is, however, an opportunity to utilise nuisance macroalgae by creating useful and economically viable products. Thus relieving pressure on diminishing, but sought-after natural resources. Here we have undertaken a systematic review of the literature to synthesise data from 639 peer-reviewed papers to: identify the spatial and temporal nature of macroalgal blooms; quantify the ecological and socio-economic impacts associated with these blooms; outline the conversion of macroalgal biomass into products, in particular for the main blooming genera; provide an assessment of input and product costs for different compounds; and provide feasibility assessments generated from Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) and Life Cycle Assessments (LCA). Globally, green macroalgae (chlorophyta), predominately Ulva spp. (52%), were found to be the most reported and spatially distributed blooming algae. However, the largest single bloom was produced by Sargassum spp. (phaeophyta), producing >20 million tonnes in 2018. Ecologically, the dominant negative impacts of macroalgal blooms were a decline in species richness and abundance; with seagrasses and fish most impacted. Social and economic impacts of macroalgal blooms were under-reported in peer-reviewed papers and globally under-researched, but where reported, there were clear negative impacts. For nuisance green macroalgal species, biorefining to produce multiple products was the most researched application, yet in the feasibility assessments there was a stronger case for biofuel production. Limited TEA or LCA were identified focussing on bloom material. There is an urgent need for research to provide the tools for the effective utilisation of macroalgal blooms. We recommend increased research into bioprocessing and a TEA of nuisance macroalgal blooms especially for Ulva and other chlorophyta, which are predominantly problematic. If this is achievable then exciting pathways utilising problem macroalgae can be incorporated into the circular economy. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Direct electrochemical electron transfer (DET) of oxidoreductases has attracted increasing attention in pure and applied bioelectrochemistry (e.g. biosensors and biofuel cells) over the last decades. We report here a systematic study of DET-type bioelectrocatalysis of the membrane-bound redox enzyme fructose dehydrogenase (FDH, Gluconobacter sp.), on variable-length and variably terminated thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) both on Au(111) and nanoporous gold (NPG) electrodes. FDH on Au(111) modified by short-chain moderately hydrophilic 2-mercaptoethanol (BME) SAMs exhibits the highest DET activities and largest DET-capable fraction. Fitting of theoretical polarization curves to the data and homology modeling/docking of FDH offer further mechanistic insight. The dependence of the DET efficiency of FDH on the length and differently terminated carbon chain is systematically presented. The decreased DET rate with increasing chain length is associated with increasingly unfavourable long-range electron tunnelling, and not with lowered enzyme loading. The porous structure of NPG is favorable for FDH bioelectrocatalysis by improving both efficient enzyme orientation and operational stability. Overall, our study maps systematically the controlled local environmental structural flexibility of the Au/SAM/enzyme/solution interface, a paradigm for thiol modified surfaces in biosensors and bioelectronics. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Microalgae are being promoted as a superior alternative feedstock for sustainable biofuel production and recently they are also being increasingly recognized as phytoremediation agents in bioremediation. Other than these, microalgae have been utilized as a sustainable feed in aquaculture for many years. The success of microalgae as a feed is based on the nutritional quality of microalgae, which are rich in protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial biologically active components such as carotenoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Standards for the evaluation of microalgae include the assessment of various qualities such as digestibility, bioavailability, and toxicity analysis. This review provides comprehensive information regarding the current status and desirable characteristics of microalgae as a feed ingredient. Feed quality assessments such as protein quality, toxicological and microbiological analysis for microalgae are discussed. The techno-functional components of microalgae are presented in the feed perspective. The utilization of microalgae in various animal husbandry sectors and aquaculture are summarized. The advantages – disadvantages of microalgae as a feed is also presented, along with future research prospects. In short, this review will provide an overall view of the nutritional quality of microalgae and its beneficial application as a sustainable feed ingredient. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of algae in biofuel production is more sustainable as compared to crop-based resources as it doesn't compromise food security, rainforests, or arable land. Furthermore, the utilization of molecular biology methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 with guided RNA for genetic modification in algae has opened up new avenues to meet the future energy demand. Recently, a progressive shift in the paradigm of algal growth from an open system (raceways) to a closed system (e.g.; PBRs) has been observed because the latter is more efficient in biofuel production as it provides optimized growth conditions. Several algal species have been genetically engineered and characterized for different parameters, especially their ability to grow in a closed system. Since the advent of the closed system viz. fermenters for industrial applications, several advancements have been made in its design and functions to optimize the growth of industrially used microbial strains and the yield of their bio-products. Genetically engineered algae have diverse growth condition requirements varying even at strain levels, consequently, an enormous amount of significant information or data is available on the optimization of algal growth conditions in PBRs. In conjunction with different computational biological approaches, the high throughput analysis of data becomes fast, enabling to predict the scale-up production process and capital cost and investment requirements. Systematic and planned, altogether applications of genetic engineering, PBRs, and computational approaches should not only help to make the production of fourth-generation biofuels more convenient but also pave the way of different interdisciplinary approaches to be used in algal biofuel production processes in near future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is typically produced from a wide variety of edible vegetable oils. The cost of biofuels is projected to rise in the future as an alternative and ecologically suitable replacement to traditional fuel. Reliable and inexpensive raw materials, including meat processing by-products or waste animal fats, have rapidly attracted interest in biodiesel production. The operational and reaction parameters play an important role in the conversion of processes and biodiesel yield. Kinetic models explain the reaction rate and process optimization to improve the biodiesel conversion process. The process intensification approaches applied by different researchers are illustrated in the current study. This paper proposes a groundbreaking solution to stepping up biodiesel development by utilizing a coalescer reactor and a preliminary review to justify the solution's potential for further analysis. Optimization techniques and kinetics studies used to enhance biodiesel production from renewable sources are explored in the current review paper. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Organic acids produced during the fermentation of lactic acid bacteria inhibit cellular growth and the production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO). Lactobacillus reuteri JH83, which has an increase of 18.6% in organic acid resistance, was obtained through electron beam irradiation mutagenesis irrelevant to the problem of genetically modified organisms. The maximum bioconversion of 1,3-PDO in fed-batch fermentation using pure glycerol by L. reuteri JH83 was 93.2 g/L at 72 h, and the productivity was 1.29 g/L·h, which achieved an increase by 34.6%, compared to that of the wild-type strain. In addition, the result of fed-batch fermentation for the production of 1,3-PDO using crude glycerol was not significantly different from that of pure glycerol. Additionally, transcriptome analysis confirmed changes in the expression levels of sucrose phosphorylase, which is a major facilitator superfamily transporter, and muramyl ligase family proteins, which protect lactic acid bacteria from various stressors, such as organic acids. © 2021

AB  - Bioethanol production from non-crop based lignocellulosic material has reached the commercial scale and is advocated as a possible solution to decarbonize the transport sector. This study evaluates how much presently used transport related fossil fuels can be replaced with lignocellulosic bioethanol using crop residues, calculates greenhouse gas emission savings, and determines lignocellulosic bioethanol's land, water, and carbon footprints. We estimate global bioethanol production potential from 123 crop residues in 192 countries and 20 territories under different environmental constraints (optimistic and realistic sustainable potentials) versus no constraints (theoretical potential) on residue availability. Previous studies on global bioethanol production potential from lignocellulosic material focused on one or few biomass feedstocks, and excluded (un)constrained residue availability scenarios. Our results suggest the global net lignocellulosic bioethanol output ranges from 7.1 to 34.0 EJ per annum replacing between 7% and 31% of oil products for transport yielding relative emission savings of 338 megatonne (Mt; 70%) to 1836 Mt (79%). Emission savings range from 4% to 23% of total transport emissions in the realistic sustainable versus theoretical potential. Land, water and carbon footprints of net bioethanol vary between potentials, countries/territories, and feedstocks, but overall exceed footprints of conventional bioethanol. Averaged footprints range between 0.14 and 0.24 m2 land per megajoule (MJ−1), 74–120 L water MJ−1, and 28–44 g CO2 equivalent MJ−1, with smaller footprints in the theoretical potential caused by the exclusion of secondary residues and low price of alternative biomass chains in the sustainable potential. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Dunaliella sp. microalgae are well known for their use in the recovery of high value compounds or as whole cells in various biotechnological applications. The aim of this work aims to review the applications of Dunaliella sp. in the production of compounds with therapeutic (antioxidant, anticancer and anti-inflammatory) activity, in bioremediation techniques and in the production of biofuels. A literature search conducted using Google Scholar, Science Direct and NCBI (PubMed) electronic databases made it possible to select original studies published in English from 2009 to 2020. Two authors of this review independently assessed, against six eligibility criteria, a total of 651 articles, 88 of which were selected for further analysis and subjected to risk of bias assessment. In most of the studies Dunaliella salina was used in therapeutic applications, mainly related to the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids as well as the antioxidant activity of whole cells. Bioremediation was the second most reported application using whole cells of the Dunaliella salina species, while the lipid fraction of Dunaliella tertiolecta biomass was used for biofuels production. Most of the articles responded positively to the criteria, for which they were considered to be at low risk of bias, while only one criterion was at high risk and one at medium risk of bias. The survey highlighted positive effects of Dunaliella biomass and its compounds in different biotechnological applications. However, further studies focused on the mechanisms of action of Dunaliella for therapeutic use, bioremediation and biofuel production are needed to improve outcomes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The anaerobic degradation of coal combined with straw biomass can promote the methane production. The biogas production potential and metabolic pathway were explored via the co-digestion simulation experiment of coal and corn straw. The results showed that 2 g of corn straw combined respectively with 4 g of bituminous coal A, 6 g of bituminous coal B and 4 g of bituminous coal C resulted in highest methane yields. The structure of lignocellulose in corn straw was partially degraded into guaiacyl and syringyl units. Meanwhile, the content of biodegradable tyrosine like protein and soluble microbial by-products in liquid phase significantly decreased. Significantly, the structure of archaea altered from aceticlastic to hydrogenotrophic methanogens when the fermentation substrate changed from high to low rank coal. The proportion of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was significantly higher than that of aceticlastic and methylotrophic methanogens, and the hydrogenotrophic pathway was dominant than the aceticlastic pathway. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wastewater management and its treatment have revolutionized the industry sector into many innovative techniques. However, the cost of recycling via chemical treatment has major issues especially in economically poor sectors. On the offset, one of the most viable and economical techniques to clean wastewater is by growing microalgae in it. Since wastewater is rich in nitrates, phosphates and other trace elements, the environment is suitable for the growth of microalgae. On the other side, the cost of harvesting microalgae for its secondary metabolites is burgeoning. While simultaneously growing of microalgae in photobioreactors requires regular feeding of the nutrients and maintenance which increases the cost of operation and hence cost of its end products. The growth of microalgae in waste waters makes the process not only economical but they also manufacture more amounts of value added products. However, harvesting of these values added products is still a cumbersome task. On the offset, it has been observed that pretreating the microalgal biomass with ultrasonication allows easy oozing of the secondary metabolites like oil, proteins, carbohydrates and methane at much lower cost than that required for their extraction. Among microalgae diatoms are more robust and have immense crude oil and are rich in various value added products. However, due to their thick silica walls they do not ooze the metabolites until the mechanical force on their walls reaches certain threshold energy. In this review recycling of wastewater using microalgae and its pretreatment via ultrasonication with special reference to diatoms is critically discussed. Perspectives on circular bioeconomy and knowledge gaps for employing microalgae to recycle wastewater have been comprehensively narrated. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Outbreaks of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms present a serious threat to ecosystem safety and human well-being. Removal of toxic cyanobacterial biomass from freshwaters and its safe utilization is a worldwide problem. We showed that regulation of intracellular carbon flow by applying nitrogen deprivation strategy with light and inorganic carbon manipulation during the cultivation of cyanobacterium Microcystis allows efficiently convert its biomass into the biofuel feedstock. The proteomic analysis demonstrated that highly efficient feedstock production can be achieved during Microcystis culturing by nitrogen deprivation, which slows down the catabolic consumption of carbohydrates in cells. Further, we developed a novel approach that allows converting the natural Microcystis biomass into carbohydrate-rich feedstock by maintaining a high rate of carbohydrate production at minimal biomass losses. The yield attains 0.22 g ethanol per gram dry biomass, which is in the range of the ethanol yield of sugarcane, but higher than the values of sugarcane waste. The suggested approach provides cost-effective technology for sustainable green energy production from nuisance cyanobacterial biomass. The massive removal of toxic cyanobacterial biomass for bioethanol productions can mitigate the harmful cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes, and positively affect their restoration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Picochlorum celeri has among the fastest photoautotrophic growth rates (~2 h doubling time in optimal conditions) reported to date for a marine alga. This study comprehensively analyzes the levels of Picochlorum celeri photosynthetic pigments, which can reach up to ~13% of the total particulate organic carbon (POC) under light-limiting conditions. The main Picochlorum celeri pigments identified include: chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, lutein, β-carotene, canthaxanthin, violaxanthin, neoxanthin, zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin. The ketocarotenoid canthaxanthin can accumulate up to 120 mg L−1 in Picochlorum celeri liquid culture; ~12% of it was found in an extracellular polysaccharide matrix. Using a solar-simulating automated photobioreactor, we monitor the photoacclimation of cultures maintained in unshaded conditions (&lt;0.5 μg mL−1 of total chlorophyll) through transitions from high irradiance (1000 μmoles photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) m−2 s−1) to low irradiance (60 μmoles PAR m−2 s−1), and conversely from low to high irradiance. Canthaxanthin and zeaxanthin accumulation are among the most rapid modulation responses when cultures are shifted from low to high irradiance. The violaxanthin, antherazanthin, and zeaxanthin (VAZ) pool is ~3-fold higher in high-light cultures, suggesting that the VAZ cycle combined with a dramatic reduction in chlorophyll levels are among the major mechanisms used in Picochlorum celeri to efficiently acclimate to high-irradiance levels. Responsive pigment modulation was also observed in denser cultures (~0.65 g L−1) grown under a diel cycle (pond-mimicking conditions). This research provides unique insights into the dynamics of pigment modulation and photoacclimation in response to changing irradiance in a biotechnologically promising alga and will inform future pigment engineering strategies to further improve light capture and biomass accumulation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Brown macroalgae, so called seaweed, has shown promising potential to produce biofuel and biobased chemicals. However, a single-product biorefinery producing biofuel from seaweed at an industrial scale has many economic obstacles, hindering its commercialization. In the present contribution, a model-based process analysis was performed in which (1) the main economic barriers of an only-fuel approach were studied extensively, (2) an innovative biorefinery approach was applied to remove the economic impediments and pave the way to the commercialization of a seaweed-based biorefinery. Nizimuddinia zanardini, a natural and widely available brown macroalga in Iran, was chosen as the plant's feedstock. In the only-fuel approach, the seaweed was used to produce fuel ethanol and electricity exclusively. In the biorefinery approach, an integrated process was applied to produce fuel ethanol, electricity, and high-value chemicals, i.e., mannitol, alginate, and protein. Simulations were conducted by Aspen Plus®, and the results were employed to perform an economic analysis. Considering the internal rate of return of 20% for the plant location, the profitability indices of both process frameworks were calculated. Based on the profitability indices, the only-fuel approach was economically unviable, mainly due to the low conversion rate of ethanol from seaweed carbohydrates. On the other hand, the biorefinery approach was cost-effective, having produced highly valuable chemicals. Therefore, it is much more lucrative to produce high-value chemicals besides biofuel than to exclusively produce biofuel from seaweed feedstock. The maximum allowable dry seaweed price (MDSP) was −64 and 374 US$ per ton of dry seaweed for the only-fuel and biorefinery approaches, respectively. MDSP of the biorefinery approach can be used to set a benchmark price for future studies on seaweed cultivation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current research focuses on the Intracellular biosynthesis of Ag/AgCl nanohybrids in microalgae, Scenedesmus sp. The effect of biosynthesis process on growth and lipid profile of cells is key element of this study. Ag/AgCl nanohybrids synthesized intracellularly were characterized by UV–Vis spectrophotometer, Powder X-Ray Diffraction (P-XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM). 10–20 nm and 10–50 nm sized spherical shaped nanoparticles of polycrystalline nature were grown using 0.5 and 1 mM of AgNO3 precursor, respectively and Scenedesmus sp. as reducing agent. Total lipid content of the cells treated with 0.5 mM and 1 mM AgNO3 was static and found to be 43.2 ± 0.01 μg/mL and 48.2 ± 0.02 μg/mL respectively at 120 h of Ag/AgCl nanoparticles biosynthesis. FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) profile was improved due to intracellular nanoparticles biosynthesis with maximum C16:0 (palmitic acid) (35.7%) in cells treated with 0.5 mM AgNO3 used for Ag/AgCl nanohybrids synthesis. Palmitic acid in cells exposed to 0.5 mM concentration of metallic precursor increased by 75.86%. Synthesized nanoparticles were tested on four bacterial strains to establish its antibacterial efficiency showing appropriate zone of inhibition at varying concentrations. Present study efficiently demonstrates the utility of microalgae integrating nanoparticles biosynthesis and lipid accumulation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Thermal/ultrasonic pre-treatment of sludge has been proven to break the hydrolysis barriers of sewage sludge (SS) and improve the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD). In this study, the objective was to investigate whether the combination of two pre-treatment methods can achieve better results on the AD of SS. The results indicated that, compared with the control group and separate pre-treatment groups, the thermal combined ultrasonic pre-treatment presented more obvious solubilization of soluble proteins, polysaccharides, and other organic matters in SS. The combined method promoted the dissolution of protein-like substances more effectively, with biogas production increased by 19% and the volatile solid (VS) removal rate improved to above 50% compared with the control group. The capillary suction time is reduced by about 85%, which greatly improved the dewatering performance of SS. In addition, the combined method has advantages in degrading sulfonamide antibiotics, roxithromycin and tetracycline. Particularly, by analyzing the interaction between the degradation of different antibiotics and the composition of dissolved organic matters (DOMs), it was found that the composition of DOMs could affect the degradability of different antibiotics. Among them, the high content of tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like was conducive to the degradation of sulfamethoxazole, and the high content of fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like was conducive to the degradation of roxithromycin and tetracycline. This work evaluated the comprehensive effect of thermal combined ultrasonic pre-treatment on SS disposal and provided useful information for its engineering. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgal biomass has received a great deal of attention as renewable and environmental-friendly biofuel feedstock as a rebuttal to climate change, energy crisis, and global warming. To improve the commercial viability of algal biodiesel production, the rise in lipid accretion and the enrichment of algal fatty acid profile are of utmost importance. In this experiment, lipid content and fatty acid methyl ester profiling of the microalgal strain, Scenedesmus sp. is done to understand the intercalating effect of different media composition for its suitability in context to biodiesel production. Various nutrient combinations (sodium nitrate, NaNO3) and di-potassium hydrogen phosphate, (K2HPO4) were incorporated along with salinity (sodium chloride) exposure for first 48 h stage of algal cultivation, followed by oxidative stress via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the second 24 h stage of cultivation. The results show that the presence of 100 mM NaCl, 35.29 mM NaNO3, and 5.74 mM K2HPO4 followed by the addition of 10 mM H2O2 (S100H10N35.29P5.74) to the algal growth media led to the accumulation of maximum total lipid content (226.49 ± 16.6 μg/mg). Another nutrient combination, S0H10N35.29P0, increased the saturated fatty acid composition (C16:0) to 31.7%. Principal component analysis (PCA) also demonstrated the combined effect of multiple nutrient components and their relative concentrations on the growth parameters and algal biochemical profile, such as biomass, chlorophyll, lipid, carbohydrate, alongwith fatty acid profiling. Hence, this study demonstrate the potential of Scenedesmus sp. in response to a multi-component stress environment that has influenced the fate of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) composition and significantly improved the quality of algal biofuels produced over a short period. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we introduced a novel method for synthesis of a highly redox-active surface-confined Hydroquinone on MWCNT modified glassy carbon electrode surface, GCE/MWCNT@H2Q using the earth-abundant lignocellulose-biomass product, syringaldehyde (Syn) by one-step potential cycling and potentiostatic polarization method in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution that can show an efficient ascorbic acid electrocatalytic signal better than the conventional redox-mediators suitable to use as an anode in biofuel cell and selective electrochemical sensor applications in neutral pH solution. This new electrode showed a well-defined redox peak at Eo′ = −0.15 V(A2/C2) and 0.0 V(A3/C3) vs Ag/AgCl corresponding to the redox-active molecular species of H2Q and its polymerized product, Poly-H2Q. Based on various physicochemical techniques like Raman, IR, TGA, DTA, TEM, GC–MS, H1-NMR and scanning electrochemical microscope imaging using substrate generation/tip-collection mode, it has been revealed that Syn-precursor underwent a demethoxylation and hydration upon the electrochemical preparation condition. It has been proposed that the Poly-H2Q is an active site for the selective electrocatalytic oxidation of AA in a neutral pH solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Electromethanogenesis (EMG) system could efficiently convert CO2 to CH4 by using excess renewable electricity. However, the fluctuation and interruption of renewable electricity will adversely affect the biocathode and therefore the CH4 production of the EMG system. In this work, a novel biocathode acclimation strategy with intermittent step-up voltage (ISUV) was proposed to improve the stability and resilience of the EMG system against the unstable input of renewable power. Compared with the intermittent application of constant voltage (IACV), the ISUV increased the rate of CH4 production by 11.7 times with the improvement of the stability and resilience by 56% and 500%, respectively. Morphology and microflora structure analysis revealed that the biofilm enriched with ISUV exhibited a compact microflora structure with high-density cells and nanowires interconnected. This study provided a novel effective strategy to regulate the biofilm structure and enhance the performance of the EMG system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioethanol as fuel oxygenator is currently being introduced in Mexico with an estimated yearly demand of 3 billion liters expected to be produced mainly from sugarcane. This paper studies how to employ some of the expertise acquired by Brazil during its transition from typical mills into advanced biorefineries to retrofit the Mexican sucroalcohol industry. A typical Mexican sugarcane factory design is retrofitted to three biorefinery designs commonly found in Brazil, which are an autonomous distillery, a biorefinery with 50:50 feedstock ratio for ethanol and sugar production and a molasses distillery. The results of a techno-economic analysis considering these four designs under Mexican conditions are presented, followed by an economic comparison of the autonomous distillery design operating under Mexican and Brazilian conditions. Sustainability analysis is then carried out to identify the advantages and drawbacks of each design. The analysis compares an environment-driven scenario promoting bioethanol production and use for phasing out fossil fuels, against a commercially focused framework considering only environmental and economic issues affecting stakeholders’ profit. Results show in monetary terms the impact of each indicator of a retrofitting path from currently profitable biorefineries coproducing sugar and alcohol to sustainable distilleries using molasses and juice as feedstock to produce bioethanol. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, single-chamber and dual-chamber Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) with carbon fiber brushes as electrodes were operated at 15°C to compare and analyze the difference in methanogenic performance. Metatranscriptomic analysis showed that the relative abundance of electroactive microorganisms Syntrophomonas, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides in each group exceeded 90%, while the abundance of Geobacter was less than 4%. Acetoclastic methanogens Methahnosarcina was more enriched in dual-chamber MES (61.74%~70.42%), and Methanothrix showed higher abundance in single-chamber MES (33.44%~51.71%). Methahnosarcina and Methanothrix could interact with electroactive microorganisms to improve the electron transfer efficiency through direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). Analysis of the methane metabolic pathways of low-temperature MES found acetoclastic pathway was domination, and single-chamber MES achieved acetate to acetyl-CoA through acetate-CoA ligase (EC: 6.2.1.1), whereas dual-chamber MES was by acetate kinase (EC: 2.7.2.1) and phosphate acetyltransferase (EC: 2.3.1.8). These results are beneficial to further research on the treatment of low-temperature wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy is considered a conserved quantity. With numerous applications, it's available in a different form from various resources. Hence production energy depends on the available resources and efficiency. The purpose of the research work is to produce bioethanol from waste rose flower petals. Four different steps namely pre-treatment, hydrolysis fermentation, and distillation were used for bioethanol conversion. Advanced techniques such as Fourier infrared transformation, scanning electron micrography, X-ray diffraction, and thermal analysis were employed to determine the best precondition. At a most favorable condition of hydrolysis time = 120 h; temperature 30 °C, enzyme concentration = 1.75 g/L, pH 5.5, and mixing speed 120 rpm give the highest glucose yields 40.8 g/L with commercial enzyme Accellerase 1500. In addition to that at pH 4.5, fermentation time 192hrs and temperature 30 °C, a maximum of 29.5 g/L bioethanol was produced. The bioethanol was confirmed by 1HNMR, gas chromatography analysis, and infrared transformation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent times to address the energy issues, the use of microalgal feedstock as third generation biofuel has gained significance due to sustainability and feasibility. Compared to terrestrial plants, it has a higher growth rate and superior CO2 and sunlight fixation capacity; along with higher lipid content. However, a major bottleneck which impedes the mass production of microalgal oil is the high cost of harvesting. Therefore, energy efficient and eco-friendly harvesting techniques are crucial to improve the economic viability of algal biofuel production. In this study, pellet forming Aspergillus sp. was evaluated for the efficient biomass recovery of Chlorella sp. MJ11/11 through the process of fungal pelletization. The effect of different process factors like: rotational speed of the shaker, pH, nutrients and cationic agent concentrations in the media on biomass recovery were evaluated. When algae: fungi were used in 1:3 w/w ratios, more than 90% harvesting efficiency was obtained at pH 3 within 5 h. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed changes in the C-H and C-N groups indicating their role in co-pelletization process. The CHNS characterization of the co-pellet showed an improved C/N ratio, with a high heating value of 19.55 MJ Kg−1. The lipid and biomass concentration of the co-pellet was 332 mg L−1 and 2.37 ± 0.12 g L−1 respectively. Also, the X-ray diffraction analysis indicated an increase in the amorphous property of the co-pellet; demonstrating the suitability of the algal fungal co-pellet as a substrate for biofuel production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Co-cultures of different microorganisms are considered promising inocula for treating palm oil mill effluents (POME) and producing value-added bio-products (e.g., biofuels and fatty acid-derived materials). However, the efficiency of yeast-bacteria co-culture for microbial lipid production through bioremediation of wastewater remains a bottleneck. In this study, the performance of a co-culture for lipid accumulation through POME bioremediation was investigated using a yeast (Lipomyces starkeyi) and a bacterium (Bacillus cereus). A maximum biomass of 8.89 ± 0.33 g/L and lipid production of 2.27 ± 0.10 g/L were achieved by the co-culture inoculum, which were substantially higher than those of the monocultures. Besides, the co-culture inoculum attained a maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 83.66 ± 1.9%, while the individual cultures of B. cereus and L. starkeyi obtained 74.35 ± 1.7% and 69.01 ± 2.3%, respectively. The bioremediation efficiency was confirmed by the seed germination index (GI) of Vigna radiata (Mung bean). It was observed that the co-culture inoculum had a higher GI compared to the untreated POME and even the monoculture-treated POME. We argue that the symbiotic association of a yeast-bacteria co-culture in POME could be an attractive approach for achieving maximum biomass as well as lipid production and simultaneous bioremediation of POME. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-situ corn fiber conversion enables to greenly convert corn fiber into bioethanol with saving energy and capital expenditure. However, the remaining challenge is to understand how the additive cellulases improve substrate utilization efficiency but reduce the side-product glycerol concentration. Herein, we investigated a comprehensive responses pattern of cellulases-assisted ethanol production on fermentation properties and transcriptomic level. Two determinants, glucose release rate and viscosity, were identified to govern ethanol/glycerol ratio disturbance. The transcriptomic studies revealed three genes in ethanol synthetic and two genes in synthetic glycerol pathway present remarkably up-regulated (up to 4.28-fold) and down-regulated (up to 4.81-fold) under cellulases condition, respectively. Interestingly, 15 upregulated/downregulated genes were commonly obtained in (non-)cellulases and (non-)sodium-polyacrylate transcriptomic landscape, suggesting the reduced glycerol concentration most likely result from the decreased broth viscosity. This obtained knowledge unmask molecular mechanisms of cellulases-assisted ethanol improvement and empower engineers to rationally optimize the biofuel process for higher ethanol concentration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To realize the synchronous purification of raw biogas and biogas slurry, the algal-fungal symbiont pellets were cultivated by supplementing strigolactone (GR24) under different mixed LED light wavelengths. The optimal light intensity was proved to be red and blue in the ratio of 5:5. The symbionts treated with 10−9 M GR24 had the highest growth rate and mean daily productivity. The extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity and the content of chlorophyll were also affected by GR24 concentrations and mixed light wavelengths. With the induction of 10−9 M GR24, the maximum removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus reached 76.35 ± 6.87%, 78.77 ± 7.13% and 79.49 ± 7.43%, respectively. Besides, the CO2 removal efficiency reached 59.32 ± 5.19% when the concentration of GR24 was 10−7 M. This work will be beneficial for large-scale biogas slurry purification and biogas upgrading using co-cultivation of microalgae and fungi. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in global population size over the past 100 decades has doubled the requirements for energy resources. To mitigate the limited fossil fuel available, new clean energy sources being environmental sustainable for replacement of traditional energy sources are explored to supplement the current scarcity. Biomass containing lignin and cellulose is the main raw material to replace fossil energy given its abundance and lower emission of greenhouse gases and NOx when transformed into energy. Bacteria, fungi and algae decompose lignocellulose leading to generation of hydrogen, methane, bioethanol and biodiesel being the clean energy used for heating, power generation and the automobile industry. Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) uses microorganisms to decompose biomass in wastewater to generate electricity and remove heavy metals in wastewater. Biomass contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other biomacromolecules which need hydrolyzation for conversion into small molecules by corresponding enzymes in order to be utilized by microorganisms. This paper discusses microbial decomposition of biomass into clean energy and the five major ways of clean energy production, and its economic benefits for future renewable energy security. © 2021

AB  - This study reports on the novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae CU-TPD4 that was isolated from coconut waste residues obtained from a coconut factory in Thailand. The CU-TPD4 isolate was confirmed to be a S. cerevisiae by molecular analysis and to be an oleaginous yeast with more than 20% (w/w) of the cell dry weight (CDW) present in the form of lipids. The lipid content and lipid yield of CU-TPD4 (52.96 ± 1.15% of CDW and 1.78 ± 0.06 g/L, respectively) under optimized growth conditions were much higher than those under normal growth conditions (22.65 ± 1.32% of CDW and 1.24 ± 0.12 g/L, respectively). The major fatty acids produced by CU-TPD4 were oleic (C18:1), palmitoleic (C16:1), stearic (C18:0), and palmitic (C16:0) acids. Mathematical estimation of the physical properties of the biodiesel obtained by transesterification of the extracted lipid suggested it was suitable as biodiesel with respect to the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 international standards. Consequently, S. cerevisiae CU-TPD4 is expected to emerge as a promising alternative for biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Free fatty acids (FFAs) are a useful feedstock for a range of industrial chemical synthesis applications. However, efficiently converting FFAs to molecules for biofuel and other high-value chemicals requires more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Cytochrome P450 fatty acid peroxygenases (CYP152) have a unique chemistry that allows use of the peroxide shunt pathway for biochemical conversion of FFAs. Known CYP152s are heat labile, however, requiring characterization of more thermotolerant versions for use in industrial applications. A fatty acid peroxygenase from Bacillus methanolicus (CYP152K6) was shown here to have a higher optimal reaction temperature than OleT (CYP152L1). CYP152K6 was stable up to 50 °C and showed great stability in 3% acetone and dimethylformamide. Stability in solvents helps the enzyme's substrates remain soluble in solution for more efficient catalysis, and heat stability allows enzymes to remain active longer during industrial processes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Worldwide, the production of plastics is increasing, and plastic pollution in aquatic environments is a major global concern. Under natural conditions, plastic weathers to smaller pieces called microplastics (MP), which come in various shapes, with fibers often being the most common in freshwater sediments. The hyporheic zone, an ecotone between surface and groundwater, is important for the transport and fate of all MP particles. The main metabolic pathways in rivers take place in the hyporheic zone and are driven by a diverse microbial community. The objective of this study was to investigate in situ whether the presence of PET fibers in riverbed sediments affects patterns of colonization and the seasonal dynamics of microbial metabolic activities in the hyporheic zone. The effects of the presence of PET on microbial metabolism were evaluated in situ over a month (colonization study) and over a year (seasonal study) by measuring total protein content (TPC), and microbial respiration as respiratory electron transport system activity (ETSA) and by community-level physiological profiling (CLPP). Additionally, PET fibers were examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and isotopic analysis (δ13C) of PET was performed after one year of exposure to field conditions. The findings demonstrated that during colonization and biofilm formation, and also over the seasons, the date had a large and significant impact on biofilm growth and activity, while PET presence slightly suppressed microbial biomass (TPC) and respiratory activity (ETSA). Overall microbial activity was repressed in the presence of PET fibers but there was a higher capacity for the utilization of complex synthetic polymer substrates (i.e., Tween 40) which have previously been linked to polluted environments. SEM micrographs showed diverse microbial communities adhering to PET fibers but little surface deterioration. Similarly, isotopic analysis suggested little deterioration of PET fibers after one year of in situ conditions. The study indicated that PET fibers present in riverbed sediments could have impacts on the metabolic functioning in rivers and thus affect their self-cleaning ability. © 2021

AB  - The study shows how microalgae biofilm formation and antioxidant responses to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is alter by the presences of Lemna minor L., Chlorella vulgaris, and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. The study involves the cultivation of the biofilm of Chlorella vulgaris and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in three bioreactors. The condition of growth for the biofilm formation was varied across the three bioreactors to enable the dominance Chlorella vulgaris and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae in one of the bioreactors. Lemna minor L. was also introduce into one of the bioreactors to determine its effect on the biofilm formation. The result obtained shows that C. vulgaris and A. flos-aquae dominate the biofilm, resulting in a high level of H2O2 and O2- (H2O2 was 0.122 ± 0.052 and 0.183 ± 0.108 mmol/L in C. vulgaris and A. flos-aquae, respectively, and O2- was 0.261 ± 0.039 and 0.251 ± 0.148 mmol/L in C. vulgaris and A. flos-aquae, respectively). The study also revealed that the presence of L. minor L. tend to reduce the oxidative stress to the biofilm leading to low production of ROS (H2O2 was 0.086 ± 0.027 and 0.089 ± 0.045 mmol/L in C. vulgaris and A. flos-aquae respectively, and O2- was 0.185 ± 0.044 and 0.161 ± 0.065 mmol/L in C. vulgaris and A. flos-aquae respectively). The variation in the ability of the biofilm of C. vulgaris and A. flos-aquae to respond via chlorophyll, carotenoid, flavonoid, anthocyanin, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase activities, antioxidant reducing power, phosphomolybdate activity, DPPH reduction activity, H2O2 scavenging activity, lipid content and organic carbon also supports the fact that the presence of biomass of microalgae and aquatic macrophytes tend to affect the process of microalgae biofilm formation and the ability of the biofilm to produce antioxidant. This high nutrient utilization leads to the production of biomass which can be used for biofuel production and other biotechnological products. © 2021

AB  - Methanogenesis involves several enzymes with trace metal components that catalyze major metabolic pathways and, therefore, requires a sufficient supply of micronutrients such as iron, nickel or cobalt. The statistically-based Plackett-Burman experimental design was adopted in this study to identify which trace metal have a statistically significant effect on the maximum methane production from domestic sewage. The addition of Barium (Ba), Cobalt (Co), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni) and Selenium (Se) was tested in batch reactors using domestic sewage as the substrate and sewage sludge as the inoculum. The results showed that the addition of Fe was statistically significant, positively affecting the maximum CH4 production (p-value 0.05). The results are expressed in L of CH4 per g of Chemical Oxygen Demand added, increasing it from 0.10 to 0.13 LCH4 gCODadd−1. In L of CH4 per g of Volatile Solids, increased it from 0.031 to 0.040 LCH4 gVS−1. The addition of Se was statistically significant, but with a negative effect on the maximum methane production (p-value 0.002), which decreased from 0.13 to 0.10 LCH4.gCODadd−1. Moreover, six different Fe concentrations (0, 40, 80, 120, 160 and 200 mgL−1) were tested, showing that the addition of 120 mgL−1 had the greatest effect for statistically improving the maximum methane production, with 33% improvement (0.12 ± 0.003 to 0.16 ± 0.012 LCH4 gCODadd−1) compared to no addition of Fe and the specific CH4 production to 0.040 ± 0.001 LCH4 gVS−1. © 2021

AB  - In this work, the scale-up from 0.01 to 10 L process for the co-production of hydrogen (H2) and ethanol (EtOH) by a genetically engineered Escherichia coli that utilizes hemicellulosic hydrolysates from wheat straw pretreated (WSP) as substrate is presented. Co-production of biofuels was performed through the redirection of carbon-flux to ethanol by deleting ldhA (D-lactate dehydrogenase) and frdD (fumarate reductase) genes in an H2-overproducer strain (E. coli WDH). Resulting strain, E. coli WDH-LF (ΔhycA ΔfrdD ΔldhA), increased up to 70% and 167% the H2 and EtOH production from glucose compared with the parenteral strain. Using WSP as substrate, the yields of H2 and EtOH remained constant at all the evaluated scales. In 10 L bioreactors, the production parameters such as maximum production, production rate and yield were 5,603.0 ± 233.5 mL H2/L, 41.4 ± 4.0 mL H2/L/h, 342.7 ± 14.3 mL H2/g TRS, 7.90 ± 0.28 g EtOH/L and 0.48 ± 0.01 g EtOH/g TRS, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of the co-production of H2 and EtOH at different production scales by the engineered E. coli strain using lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock, such as wheat straw hydrolysates. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Poplar is a key player in biomass resource and a dominant species for lignocellulosic biofuel production around the world. Today, the use of poplars is mainly concentrated in the aboveground parts. However, as an important part of trees, the poplar root system developed, roots account for about 20 % of the volume of the tree, and the root material volume is very considerable and its utilization potential is huge. The root lignin is central to biomass production in poplar. However, there are very few studies on root lignin structure. Recently, we found a root-specific transcription factor, NUCLEAR FACTOR Y subunit B21 (NF-YB21), is involved in regulating root growth and lignification. In the present study, physiology, transgenosis, transcriptomics, metabolome, Confocal Raman Microscopy (CRM) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques were performed to further investigate the regulatory mechanisms of PdNF-YB21 on lignin structure in poplar roots. The results of transcriptome and metabolome showed that there were more genes and metabolites related to S-lignin synthesis in transgenic plants. Root firmness measurements, CRM and NMR results showed that overexpression of PdNF-YB21 dramatically improved root hardness, increased root lignin content and S/G ratio, and increased the concentrations of glucan, xylan and lignin in roots, which promoted root growth. In short, this present study not only illustrated the regulatory mechanisms of PdNF-YB21 on lignin structure in poplar roots, but also proposed a directive breeding of new poplar species for current biorefinery process. © 2021

AB  - In this research, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were applied for the evaluation of surface characteristics of electrochemical (amperometric) biosensor based on two composite structures consisting of perforated polycarbonate membrane modified by carbon-nanomaterials and glucose oxidase. The first structure consisted of the polycarbonate filter membrane, punctured by 400 nm holes (PCM) consequently modified with single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and graphene oxide (GO) layer (PCM/SWCNT/GO); and the other structure consisted of the same PCM, consequently modified with SWCNT and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer (PCM/SWCNT/rGO). These two composite structures were developed and applied in biosensor design. In order to form a biosensing surfaces the PCM/SWCNT/GO and PCM/SWCNT/rGO composite structures were modified by immobilized glucose oxidase (GOx). The surface of GOx modified PCM/SWCNT/GO composite structure (PCM/SWCNT/GO/GOx) was evaluated by SECM redox-competition mode at different glucose concentrations. It was determined that PCM/SWCNT/GO/GOx composite structure is suitable for the design of amperometric glucose biosensors, because SWCNT/GO layer facilitates electron transfer from GOx via the oxidation of formed catalyzed reaction product H2O2. Therefore, the PCM/SWCNT/GO/GOx structure is a promising material for the design of amperometric glucose biosensors and biofuel cells, which are useful for a wide variety of environmental purposes and green energy production using food-industry waste. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is considered as one of the hazardous wastes because improper disposal of WCO can cause significant environmental problems such as blockages of drains and sewers as well as water or soil pollution. In this review, the physical and chemical properties of WCO are evaluated along with its regulations and policies in different countries to promote WCO refined biofuels. Blended WCO can be an auxiliary fuel for municipal solid waste incinerators while the heat produced is able to form superheated steam and subsequently generate electricity via combined heat and power system. Also, WCO contains high ratio of hydrogen atoms compared to carbon and oxygen atoms, making it able to be catalytically cracked, synthesizing hydrogen gas. WCO-based biodiesel has been traditionally produced by transesterification in order to substitute petroleum-based diesel which has non-degradability as well as non-renewable features. Hence, the potentials of hazardous WCO as a green alternative energy source for electricity generation, hydrogen gas as well as biofuels production (e.g. biodiesel, biogas, biojet fuel) are critically discussed due to its attractive psychochemical properties as well as its economic feasibility. Challenges of the WCO utilization as a source of energy are also reported while highlighting its future prospects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since laccase acts specifically in lignin, the major contributor to biomass recalcitrance, this biocatalyst represents an important alternative to the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, this study investigates the laccase pretreatment and climate change effects on the hydrolytic performance of Panicum maximum. Through a Trop‐T‐FACE system, P. maximum grew under current (Control (C)) and future climate conditions: elevated temperature (2 °C more than the ambient canopy temperature) combined with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration(600 μmol mol−1), name as eT+eC. Pretreatment using a laccase‐rich crude extract from Lentinus sajor caju was optimized through statistical strategies, resulting in an increase in the sugar yield of P. maximum biomass (up to 57%) comparing to non‐treated biomass and enabling hydrolysis at higher solid loading, achieving up to 26 g L−1. These increments are related to lignin removal (up to 46%) and lignin hydrophilization catalyzed by laccase. Results from SEM, CLSM, FTIR, and GC‐MS supported the laccase‐catalyzed lignin removal. Moreover, laccase mitigates climate effects, and no significant differences in hydrolytic potential were found between C and eT+eC groups. This study shows that crude laccase pretreatment is a potential and sustainable method for biorefinery solutions and helped establish P. maximum as a promising energy crop. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The effect of foliar application of Cyanobacteria and Chlorella sp. monocultures on physiological activity, element composition, development and biomass weight of basket willow (Salix viminalis L.) and the possibility to prepare biofuel from it in the fortification process was studied. Triple foliar plant spraying with non-sonicated monocultures of Cyanobacteria (Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Microcystis aeruginosa MKR 0105) and Chlorella sp. exhibited a considerably progressive impact on metabolic activity and development of plants. This biofertilization increased cytomembrane impermeability, the amount of chlorophyll in plants, photosynthesis productivity and transpiration, as well as degree of stomatal opening associated with a decreased concentration of intercellular CO2, in comparison to control (treatments with water, Bio-Algeen S90 or with environmental sample). The applied strains markedly increased the element content (N, P, K) in shoots and the productivity of crucial growth enzymes: alkaline or acid phosphorylase, total dehydrogenases, RNase and nitrate reductase. Treatments did not affect energy properties of the burnt plants. These physiological events were associated with the improved growth of willow plants, namely height, length and amount of all shoots and their freshly harvested dry mass, which were increased by over 25% compared to the controls. The effectiveness of these treatments depended on applied monoculture. The plant spraying with Microcystis aeruginosa MKR 0105 was a little more effective than treatment with Chlorella sp. and Anabaena sp. or the environmental sample. The research demonstrate that the studied Cyanobacteria and Chlorella sp. monocultures have prospective and useful potential in production of Salix viminalis L., which is the basic energy plant around the word. In this work, a special batch reactor was used to produce torrefaction material in an inert atmosphere: nitrogen, thermogravimetric analysis and DTA analysis, like Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The combustion process of Salix viminalis L. with TG-MS analysis was conducted as well as study on a willow torrefaction process, obtaining 30% mass reduction with energy loss close to 10%. Comparing our research results to other types of biomasses, the isothermal temperature of 245◦C during thermo-chemical conversion of willow for the carbonized solid biofuel production from Salix viminalis L. biomass fertilized with Cyanobacteria and Chlorella sp. is relatively low. At the end, a SEM-EDS analysis of ash from torrefied Salix viminalis L. after carbonization process was conducted. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The prospection of new degrading enzymes of the plant cell wall has been the subject of many studies and is fundamental for industries, due to the great biotechnological importance of achieving a more efficient depolymerization conversion from plant polysaccharides to fermentable sugars, which are useful not only for biofuel production but also for various bioproducts. Thus, we explored the shotgun metagenome data of a bacterial community (CB10) isolated from sugarcane bagasse and recovered three metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). The genomic distance analyses, along with phylogenetic analysis, revealed the presence of a putative novel Chitinophaga species, a Pandoraea nosoerga, and Labrys sp. isolate. The isolation process for each one of these bacterial lineages from the community was carried out in order to relate them with the MAGs. The recovered draft genomes have reasonable completeness (72.67–100%) and contamination (0.26–2.66%) considering the respective marker lineage for Chitinophaga (Bacteroidetes), Pandoraea (Burkholderiales), and Labrys (Rhizobiales). The in-vitro assay detected cellulolytic activity (endoglucanases) only for the isolate Chitinophaga, and its genome analysis revealed 319 CAZymes, of which 115 are classified as plant cell wall degrading enzymes, which can act in fractions of hemicellulose and pectin. Our study highlights the potential of this Chitinophaga isolate provides several plant-polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - One of the most important biofuels is cellulose ethanol which is a popular material for bioethanol production. The present cellulosic ethanol production is through the cellulolytic process and this involves the splitting of complex cellulose into simple sugars through the hydrolysis process of the lignocellulose pretreated with acids and enzymes after which the product is fermented and distilled. There are, however, some challenges due to the enzymatic and acid processes based on the fact that acid hydrolysis has the ability to corrode equipment and cause unwanted waste while the enzymatic hydrolysis process requires a longer time because enzymes are costly and limited. This means there is a need for innovations to minimize the problems associated with these two processes and this led to the application of solid catalysts as the green and effective catalyst to convert cellulose to ethanol. Solid catalysts are resistant to acid and base conditions, have a high surface area, and do not cause corrosion during the conversion of the cellulose due to their neutral pH. This review, therefore, includes the determination of the cellulose potential as feedstock to be used in ethanol production as well as the preparation and application of solid catalyst as the mechanism to convert cellulose into fuel and chemicals.

AB  - In the present study, two distantly located geothermal springs, namely Badrinath Hot Spring (BHS) and Yamunotri Hot Spring (YHS) of Garhwal Himalaya were investigated for their cyanobacterial and microalgal diversity. A total of 56 species belonging to 10 microalgal and 13 cyanobacterial genera were chronicled from the selected hot springs along the gradients of temperature and other physicochemical factors. The most abundant photosynthetic forms in both springs were cyanobacteria. Synechococcus elongatus was fairly abundant in the studied springs as compared to other algal species. The different morphotypes of Synechococcus sp. were reported across the temperature gradient of 40 to 60 °C. Cyanobacterial and microalgal diversity measured by Shannon’s diversity index (H`) decreased drastically in BHS as the temperature reached &gt; 50 °C. Mastigocladus laminosus was reported in BHS as temperature ranged from 55 to 60 °C, but not observed in YHS. Some diatoms, like Navicula sp., Nitzschia sp., Cocconeis sp., etc. were reported in BHS but were absent from YHS. The Canonical correspondence analysis confirms that pH, PO4 3 – and temperature were influential factors, while ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses suggested a restricted distribution pattern of microalgae and cyanobacteria in two geographically secluded hot springs of Garhwal Himalaya. Moreover, the capability of these diverse algal forms to grow luxuriantly at elevated temperatures may be utilized in generating biomass feedstocks for the production of high-value bioactive compounds and algal biofuel, particularly in harsh outdoor conditions prevailing in tropical and subtropical areas. These algae may also be used in the bioremediation of wastewaters and sequestration of hot industrial flue gases. The genes and proteins enabling them to survive at extremely high temperatures may upgrade our understanding about the mechanisms of thermal tolerance, which would be useful in the production of industrially important thermostable enzymes/proteins. © 2021 E.

AB  - Seagrass wrack can be utilized as a raw material to produce bioethanol, a sustainable biofuel, to overcome fossil fuel exhaustion and ecological issues. The present investigation focused on the production of bioethanol from seagrass wracks, utilizing acid and enzyme hydrolysis. The results reveal that the ethanol production (0.78 ml g−1) from the seagrass species Cymodocea serrulata was maximum than C. rotundata (0.72 ml g−1) hydrolyzed by cellulase enzyme isolated from the marine actinobacterial strain. This investigation gives acceptable proof that the conversion of seagrass wrack to bioethanol could be a practical ecological solution for managing undesirable seagrass wrack, balancing carbon emission, and producing an economically valuable product. The results showed that Cymodocea species could be used as a substrate for bioethanol production. © 2021, Society for Plant Research.

AB  - Isobutanol is an important and valuable platform chemical and an appealing biofuel that is compatible with contemporary combustion engines and existing fuel distribution infrastructure. The present study aimed to compare the potential of triticale, wheat and barley starch as feedstock for isobutanol production using an engineered strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) approach showed that all three starches were viable feedstock for co-production of isobutanol and ethanol and could produce titres similar to that produced using purified sugar as feedstock. A fed-batch process using triticale starch yielded 0.006 g isobutanol and 0.28 g ethanol/g starch. Additionally, it is demonstrated that Fusarium graminearum infected grain starch contaminated with mycotoxin can be used as an effective feedstock for isobutanol and ethanol co-production. These findings demonstrate the potential for triticale as a purpose grown energy crop and show that mycotoxin-contaminated grain starch can be used as feedstock for isobutanol biosynthesis, thus adding value to a grain that would otherwise be of limited use. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Carbon loss in the form of CO2 is an intrinsic and persistent challenge faced during conventional and advanced biofuel production from biomass feedstocks. Current mechanisms for increasing carbon conservation typically require the provision of reduced co-substrates as additional reducing equivalents. This need can be circumvented, however, by exploiting the natural heterogeneity of lignocellulosic sugars mixtures and strategically using specific fractions to drive complementary CO2 emitting vs. CO2 fixing pathways. As a demonstration of concept, a coculture-coproduction system was developed by pairing two catabolically orthogonal Escherichia coli strains; one converting glucose to ethanol (G2E) and the other xylose to succinate (X2S). 13C-labeling studies reveled that G2E + X2S cocultures were capable of recycling 24% of all evolved CO2 and achieved a carbon conservation efficiency of 77%; significantly higher than the 64% achieved when all sugars are instead converted to just ethanol. In addition to CO2 exchange, the latent exchange of pyruvate between strains was discovered, along with significant carbon rearrangement within X2S. © 2021 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - Adequate water-removal techniques are requisite to remain superior biofuel quality. The effects of vibrating types and operating time on the water-removal efficiency of molecular sieves were experimentally studied. Molecular sieves of 3 Å pore size own excellent hydrophilic characteristics and hardly absorb molecules other than water. Molecular sieves of 3 Å accompanied by two different vibrating types, rotary shaking and electromagnetic stirring, were used to remove initial water from the reactant mixture of feedstock oil in order to prevent excessive growth or breeding of microorganisms in the biofuel product. The physical structure of about 66% molecular sieves was significantly damaged due to shattered collision between the magnetic bar and molecular sieves during electromagnetic stirring for 1 h. The molecular sieves vibrated by the rotary shaker appeared to have relatively higher water-removal efficiency than those by the electromagnetic stirrer and by keeping the reactant mixture motionless by 6 and 5 wt.%, respectively. The structure of the molecular sieves vibrated by an electromagnetic stirrer and thereafter being dehydrated appeared much more irregular and damaged, and the weight loss accounted for as high as 19 wt.%. In contrast, the structure of the molecular sieves vibrated by a rotary shaker almost remained original ball-shaped, and the weight loss was much less after regenerative treatment for those molecular sieves. As a consequence, the water-removal process using molecular sieves vibrated by the rotary shaker is considered a competitive method during the biofuel production reaction to achieve a superior quality of biofuels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Producing clean energy from waste biomass via pyrolysis is critical in reducing dependence on fossil fuels and alleviating their environmental impacts. Inherent potassium in low energy density coconut fibers reduces bio-oil yield and compromises bio-oil quality and the integrity of reactors within which pyrolysis occurs. The effect of consecutive hydrothermal treatment (180°C-220 °C) and water washing on coconut fiber demineralization, pyrolysis behavior, and bio-oil composition was investigated. Chemical fractionation method classified the most occurring inorganic (potassium) as ~76% water-soluble, ~19% ion-exchangeable, and ~5% acid-soluble species. Demineralization results show that combined pretreatment at ≤200 °C leached out all water-soluble and exchangeable potassium. However, at 220 °C, electrostatic attraction and increased tortuosity imposed by the high density of oxygenated functional groups and a well-developed porous structure hamper demineralization. Nevertheless, a maximum potassium removal efficiency of 95% could be achieved. Although pretreatment marginally affects apparent activation energy, the reaction mechanism of hydrochars became insensitive to the heating rate between 10 and 50 °C min−1. Due to pretreatment, the selectivity of thermally stable phenolic and anhydrosugar derivatives increased at the expense of the light oxygenates of low thermal stability because of suppressing fragmentation reactions and enriching polymers with a high degree of polymerization. Light oxygenates decreased from 27.45 area % to 24.02, 16.33, and 13.32 area % for hydrochars produced at 180 °C, 200 °C, and 220 °C, respectively. Therefore, this pretreatment approach can produce inorganic-free, thermally stable, and chemically stable bio-oils. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents a crucial cathodic process of different fuel cells. The development of highly active and stable noble metal-free ORR electrocatalysts remains as one of major challenges. Herein, we report cobalt/nitrogen co-doped porous carbon materials (Co-N-C) originated from well-designed bimetal-organic frameworks (Zn100-xCox-ZIF) as efficient ORR electrocatalysts in both pH-neutral and alkaline solutions. The compositional and structural features, and the corresponding ORR activity can be tailored by tuning the Zn/Co ratio in the precursor. Remarkable features of large surface-area and suitable graphitization degree and well-dispersed Co-N-C moieties, enable a high catalytic efficiency. The optimized electrocatalyst registers considerable ORR performance with a high half-wave potential of 0.65 V vs RHE and a saturated current density of 5.30 mA cm−2 close to the value of the commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M pH 7.0 PBS, along with considerable operational stability and tolerance to glucose. A preliminary one-compartment hybrid glucose/O2 enzymatic biofuel cell, consisting of the Co-N-C-10 abiotic cathode and a glucose oxidizing bioanode, is constructed and tested. Furthermore, Co-N-C presents reasonable ORR electrocatalytic activity and operational stability in alkaline condition. © 2021

AB  - The demand for affordable energy will continue to increase. On the other side, the utilization of fossil fuels is causing drastic changes to our climate forcing us to search for more sustainable sources of energy. Lignocellulosic biomass waste from palm oil industry in Malaysia is one of the most abundant and economically attractive sources of renewable energy. This can be utilized as the raw material for solid biofuel, i.e., Bio-Coke. Some efforts have been made to improve the quality of Bio-Coke in recent years. This study aims to determine the influence of biological pretreatment of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) on its subsequent Bio-Coke characteristics. The results show after pretreatment, the fiber structure of EFB could be seen clearly and a looser connection between single fibers is observed. The pretreatment leads to the biologically pretreated Bio-Coke having higher apparent density and longer combustion duration than the Bio-Coke without pretreatment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research aims to evaluate the co-production of hydrogen and ethanol from lignocellulosic materials by Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum KKU-ED1. The optimum conditions for co-production of hydrogen and ethanol in batch fermentation was determined using alpha-cellulose as a basic model substrate to mimic the natural cellulose part of a lignocellulosic material. The optimal conditions attained were an initial pH of 7.0, a temperature of 55 °C, and a cellulose content of 20 g/L, which resulted in the maximum hydrogen production and ethanol (EtOH) yield of 6113 mL H2/L and 1.71 mmol EtOH/g-celluloseconsumed, respectively. The potential of the KKU-ED1 strain to produce hydrogen and ethanol from natural cellulose in sugarcane bagasse was further evaluated under the optimum conditions. Hydrogen production and ethanol yield of 218 mL H2/L, and 0.26 mmol EtOH/g-celluloseconsumed were obtained. Results indicated that the strain KKU-ED1 is a thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium capable of co-producing hydrogen and ethanol from lignocellulosic materials. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, the influence behavior of new pollutants in the environment has been widely concerned. However, the effect of antidepressants widely detected in excess sludge (ES) on biohydrogen production from anaerobic dark fermentation has never been explored. To fill this gap, fluoxetine (FLX), a typical antidepressant, was selected to evaluate its effect on ES mesophilic anaerobic dark biohydrogen fermentation. The results showed that FLX reduced biohydrogen production even at low content (0.1 mg/Kg). The biohydrogen yield was only 12.8 mL/g in the 1.8 mg/Kg (based on total suspended solids) FLX group, decreased by about 34.7%, compared with the control group (without FLX). Further mechanism investigation implied that high levels (more than 0.6 mg/Kg) of FLX reduced every step associated with the biohydrogen production. FLX reduced the concentration of ammonia nitrogen and phosphate in fermentation broth. FLX also had a significant negative effect on enzyme activity in ES dark fermentation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic crops grown on marginal lands can become an important part of the European Union (EU) climate change mitigation strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and meet biofuel demand. This study quantifies spatially explicit the availability of marginal land in the EU, its production biomass potentials for eight different crops, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of advanced biofuel supply chains. Available land is mapped based on land marginality and Renewable Energy Directive Recast (REDII) land-related sustainability criteria. Biomass potentials are assessed with a water-use-to-biomass-production approach while considering the available land, location-specific biophysical conditions and crop-specific phenological characteristics. The GHG balance of advanced biofuels from energy crops produced on marginal lands is assessed considering both land-related carbon stock changes and supply chain emissions with the carbon footprint approach from the REDII. Available marginal land that meets REDII criteria is projected at 20.5–21 Mha 2030 and 2050, respectively. Due to biophysical limitations, not all available land is suitable for energy crop production. The maximum biomass potential of lignocellulosic energy crops (optimal crop choice with maximum yield for each available location) varies between 1951 PJ year−1 in 2030 and 2265 PJ year−1 in 2050. The GHG emission performance (net emissions) of different advanced biofuel supply chains varies on average between −32 g CO2-eq MJfuel−1 for poplar/willow diesel to 38 g CO2-eq (Formula presented.) for reed canary grass renewable jet fuel. The large variability in GHG performance is strongly determined by the spatial heterogeneity, which dictates the type of feedstock produced under specific local biophysical conditions, the crop characteristics, and the best conversion pathway. Negative GHG emissions are related to increased carbon stocks for the biomass and soil organic carbon pools compared to the land prior to conversion. When for each location, the advanced biofuel supply chain with the highest GHG performance (lowest net GHG emissions) is selected, 618 PJ year−1 of advanced biofuels can be produced by 2030. Under REDII GHG emission criteria, slightly less (552 PJ year−1) is viable. Smart choices on location, crop type and supply chain design are paramount to achieve maximum benefits of bioenergy systems. © 2021 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The United States is the largest global bioethanol producer and maize is the leading crop contributing towards it. Improvement in maize quality and yeast strains have enhanced ethanol production to a great extent. The high-titer ethanol production from maize biorefineries has enabled the maize biorefineries to meet the government set blending limits, which plateaued the demand for ethanol in the United States. On the other hand, growing industrial biotechnology with an emphasis on sustainability has accelerated demand for bio-based products. Therefore, the focus of maize biorefineries is now shifting on branching out the application of maize towards the bio-based markets. Recent scientific and technological advancements in the field of cellular agriculture, polymer development, and process engineering have diversified the usage of maize and inexpensive coproducts of maize biorefineries. The abundant fermentable sugars, vegetable oil, fiber, germ, and coproducts of maize fermentation have become the new platform compounds to produce next-generation high-value bio-based polymers, bulk and specialty chemicals along with biofuels and food. To meet this growing new demand, traditional maize biorefineries are evolving and positioning themselves in bio-based sustainable market sectors. This review analyzes the recent advancements in science and technologies leading to the emerging trends of maize biorefineries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High cost of lignocellulases restricts the commercialization of biofuel and bio-product production from lignocellulosic biomass. Constitutively expressed lignocellulases are considered to degrade cellulose to release small amount of soluble cellodextrins such as cellobiose for further large-scale production of lignocellulases; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, a triple β-glucosidase mutant of the model fungus Neurospora crassa, which prevents rapid turnover of cellobiose and thus allows the disaccharide to induce lignocellulases, was applied to perform parallel analyses of proteome and phosphoproteome changes in response to cellobiose and Avicel cellulose. The results revealed shared proteome and phosphoproteome responses to cellobiose and Avicel, corroborating the idea that cellobiose mediates the regulation of lignocellulase expression and secretion. The results further suggest that this regulation is achieved at multiple levels, including epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, and post-translation. Proteome profiling revealed that the proteins upregulated by cellobiose and Avicel were over-represented in cellulose degradation and degradation product transport pathways. Phosphoproteome profiling revealed that the proteins differentially phosphorylated by cellobiose and Avicel were over-represented by the pathways such as transcriptional control, protein processing and export, cell wall biogenesis, and cellular signaling. Deletion mutation analysis further suggests that the ER chaperon protein Hsp70-6, the translocation complex subunit Sec66/Sec71, and the signal peptidase subunit Spc2 are involved in lignocellulase secretion, particularly translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum. Altogether, the results offer a new insight into how cellobiose mediates the regulation of lignocellulase expression and secretion, providing a potential strategy for the strain engineering to improve lignocellulase production. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Metschnikowia pulcherrima, a non-traditional oleaginous yeast, was investigated using 0.5–20 g/L of acetic, propionic, butyric and valeric acid (four model products of anaerobic acidification) respectively as carbon sources to accumulate microbial lipids so as to produce biodiesel. The results showed that acetic acid was the most efficient carbon source for improving cell growth, lipid content and biodiesel quality. After 8 cycles non-sterile batch cultivation, M. pulcherrima still dominated in bioreactor. Controlling C/P ratio, K+ and Na+ concentrations, and initial pH could effectively enhance the lipid content to 25.79 ± 0.51%. Under nitrogen starvation, M. pulcherrima performed higher cellular activity and lipid productivity than that of phosphorous limitation. The biomass yield was about twice and the lipid content was 3% higher. Besides, different from the lipid improvement strategy of traditional oleaginous yeast, acetate from ethanol served as the precursor of M. pulcherrima cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA instead of citric acid, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was the main donor of reducing equivalent NADPH by transcriptomics sequencing analysis. These results demonstrate M. pulcherrima is a promising species for large-scale production of biofuel from organic wastes due to the low operating and maintenance costs of non-sterile cultivation, which is beneficial for reducing environmental pollution and energy shortages. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels contribute environment-friendly, renewable energy, minimizing dependence on fossil energy. The pretreatment of biomass is a practical step that accelerates and facilitates the hydrolysis of complex materials. This work aimed to screen, select, and study cocktail formulations for biomass hydrolysis, where the enzymes were provided both from a commercial source (Trichoderma reesei, Novozymes®) and through the cultivation of Aspergillus brasiliensis and Aspergillus tamarii Kita. Experimental mixture designs were used to optimize the enzymatic conversion of substrates into simple sugars. A crude extract rich in amylase (AAB) had a significant favorable influence on cornmeal hydrolysis by maximizing the yield of reducing sugars (RS) (173 μmol mL–1). Celluclast™, rich in cellulase, significantly affected the hydrolysis of banana peel, maximizing the RS yield (175 μmol mL–1). Variable degrees of enzyme synergism were evident from statistical analysis of the biomass hydrolysis. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Dinitrotoluene (DNT) has been extensively used in manufacturing munitions, polyurethane foams and other important chemical products. However, it is highly toxic and mutagenic to most organisms. Here, we synthesized a codon-optimized bacterial nitroreductase gene, NfsI, for plant expression. The kinetic analysis indicates that the recombinant NfsI can detoxify both 2,4-DNT and its sulfonate (DNTS), while it has a 97.6-fold higher catalytic efficiency for 2,4-DNT than DNTS. Furthermore, we overexpressed NfsI in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), which is a multiple-purpose crop used for fodder and biofuel production as well as phytoremediation. The 2,4-DNT treatment inhibited root elongation of wild-type switchgrass plants and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in roots. In contrast, overexpression of NfsI in switchgrass significantly alleviated 2,4-DNT-induced root growth inhibition and ROS overproduction. Thus, the NfsI overexpressing transgenic switchgrass plant removed 94.1% 2,4-DNT after 6 days, whose efficiency was 1.7-fold higher than control plants. Moreover, the comparative transcriptome analysis suggests that 22.9% of differentially expressed genes induced by 2,4-DNT may participate in NfsI-mediated 2,4-DNT detoxification in switchgrass. Our work sheds light on the function of NfsI during DNT phytoremediation for the first time, revealing the application potential of switchgrass plants engineered with NfsI. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The design of the morphology-controlled synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal oxides nanomaterials is a key for electrochemical oxidation of glucose. Herein, a general preparation method is adopted to develop a variety of transition metal oxides nanosheets, including cobalt oxide nanosheets (Co3O4 NS), nickel oxide nanosheets (NiO NS), copper oxide nanosheets (CuO NS), and iron oxide nanosheets (Fe3O4 NS) through a chemical reduction method followed by a hydrothermal strategy. The surface morphological characterization is performed by using transmission electron microscopic (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM), and atomic force microscopic (AFM) measurements, revealed the two-dimensional nanosheets-like metal oxides formed. The as-developed transition metal oxide nanosheets are employed as electrocatalysts for the improved oxidation of glucose under alkaline electrolyte. The NiO nanosheets delivers best catalytic current density of ~3.1 mA cm−2 which is over- ~1.7- and ~2.6- times higher with a less positive potential, respectively in comparison to Co3O4 nanosheets and CuO nanosheets based electrodes. The morphological engineered two-dimensional nanosheets exhibit high electrochemical active sites, fast electron transfer kinetics, etc. towards the glucose oxidation reaction (GOR). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Poaceae is the fifth largest family and one of the important plant family to mankind economically and ecologically. This family includes most important crop plants like wheat, rice and corn. It also includes forage, bamboo, biofuel and medicinal species. Grasses occupy all diverse habitat from aquatic to terrestrial, temperate to tropical, wetlands to deserts. Poaceae consists of subfamilies i.e. Bambusoideae, Oryzoideae and Pooideae (BOP clade), Panicoideae, Arundinoideae, Chloridoideae, Micrairoideae, Aristidoideae and Danthonioideae (PACMAD clade), Anomochlooideae, Pharoideae and Puelioideae. From these, Panicoideae and Chloridoideae are among the important subfamilies of Poaceae. From the past, many attempts are there for the phylogeny of Poaceae using one or more barcode genes. In the present, study 9 grass species from Kutch desert were selected and their chloroplast DNA was isolated. It was subjected to high throughput sequencing and from these complete plastomes were assembled. They were annotated by different methods and corrected. For phylogenetic analysis, total of 193 Poaceae species were selected and searched for common concatenated protein coding regions. A total of 82 common protein coding genes were extracted and one concatenated sequence was made for each species. Common barcode genes were also individually extracted and their respective phylogenetic trees were prepared by the maximum likelihood method. Statistical analysis was done using DnaSP using various parameters. In phylogeny, most barcode gives reliable phylogeny but unable to resolve some related groups. Among barcodes, the most useful candidate for Poaceae was found to be matK while resolving power of rpoC2 is the lowest. Concatenated sequence resolves all groups in their particular positions and gives accurate phylogeny. This study gives the utility of concatenated protein coding genes over traditional barcodes to resolve the phylogenetic relationship among different species of Poaceae. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study addresses the significant utility of Used Palm oil Methyl Ester (UPOME) and enhancing the capabilities by adding butyl ferulate. This phenolic antioxidant ester was synthesized using Rhizopus nevius lipase immobilised onto cuttlebone. The butyl ferulate synthesis was monitored in RP-HPLC and confirmed via GC-MS. Concurrently, UPOME was prepared using KOH as the catalyst from the used palm oil. The UPOME was fortified with ferulic acid and butyl ferulate, separately at various concentrations and subjected to thermal oxidation at 110 °C. Biodiesel prepared were estimated for oxidative stability by pattern variations deciphered from the excitation-emission matrix profile. Similarly, the induction period (IP) of the prepared biodiesels was analysed in Rancimate. The addition of the butyl ferulate at 600 ppm in UPOME was able to reduce 80% of the hydroperoxide formation whereas the free ferulic acid showed Stokes shift at the same condition and concentration. Comparatively, 3.5 fold escalation in IP was observed in UPOME with 1000 ppm butyl ferulate than the free ferulic acid. Emission characteristics depicted a significant reduction in NOx (4.7%), CO (27.8%), CO2 (8.3%) and Unburned Hydrocarbons (5.7%) when fuelled B20 with 1000 ppm BF in Compression Ignition engine. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In today's era, we need to replace chemical or physical processes of nanoparticle synthesis with biosynthesis processes to avoid environmental damage. These bioderived nanoparticles can help in addressing the problems of wastewater treatment and biofuels production. This review gives an insight into solving multiple problems using a nano-biorefinery approach in conjugation with wastewater treatment. The major advantage of using a bio-derivative method in nanoparticle synthesis is its low toxicity towards the environment. The current review discusses the development of nanoscience and its biogenic importance. It covers the usage of microalgae for (A) Nanoparticle's biosynthesis (B) Mechanism of nanoparticle biosynthesis (C) Nanoparticles in bio-refinery processes (D) Wastewater treatment with microalgae and bio-derived nanoparticles (E) A hypothetical mechanistic approach, which utilizes the photothermal effect of metallic nanoparticles to extract lipids from the cells without cell damage. The term “cell milking” has been around for quite some time, and the hypothesis discussed in the present study can help in this context. The current hypothesized process can pave ways for futuristic endeavors to conjugate nanoparticles and microalgae for viable and commercial production of biofuel, nanoparticles, and many other molecules. © 2021

AB  - The need for producing renewable fuels from biomass has increased due to depleting fossil resources and environmental concerns. However, the low fraction of biomass carbon converted to product is an undeniable drawback for most current biofuel productions from fermentation due to undecomposed lignin in biomass composition and carbon loss as CO2. In this work, two main production routes of the MixAlco® process, the ketonization route (KR) and esterification route (ER) are evaluated for the mixed alcohol production by brown algae, a third-generation biomass without lignin. A novel fermentation process using syntrophic bacteria consortia (SBC) is developed to produce acetic acid from waste gas produced by KR and ER process. The paper investigates the integrated flowsheet for these alternative routes, using techno-economic and life cycle analysis to compare the minimum selling price and environmental impacts. From TEA, we find that the overall costs for KR and ER are lower than the SBC processes. The cost of ketonization routes is lower than esterification routes. The capital cost and operating cost for the ER+SBC process are the highest. Raw materials and utilities are the two major costs for all the processing routes examined. The MSP for the ER+SBC process is the lowest out of all four routes. ER process performs the best in terms of environmental impacts except in water depletion compared with other processes, while the KR process performs the worst regarding the environmental metrics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A two-stage dilute acid and steam explosion (SE) pretreatment process was developed and evaluated at pilot scale for ethanol production from cotton gin trash (CGT). Optimal conditions for CGT processing were defined as 1:6 solids to liquids ratio with 9% H2SO4 wt. on solids at 180 °C for 15 min. during stage 1 with ensuing pressed fibres successively exposed to SE at 200 °C for 5 min during stage 2. SE fibres were highly acquiescent to enzyme hydrolysis (76%) in the presence of PEG 6000, yielding 381 g glucose kg−1 fibre. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) trials validated the selected process option and additional fed-batch SSFs confirmed titres above the minimum 4% ww-1 benchmark for economically viable distillation. The practicality of converting CGT to ethanol was demonstrated at pilot scale with titres above 4% ww-1 and a conversion efficiency of 60% t−1 dry GCT. © 2021

AB  - Deep eutectic solvent treatment to overcome lignocellulose resistance to deconstruction has great potential for the production of biofuels and bioproducts. Most investigations have been focused on optimizing the sugar yield from specific feedstocks. However, little is known about the interaction between deep eutectic solvent and cellulose during pretreatment, post-treatment cellulose accessibility to enzymes, and lignin fractionation. We evaluated four deep eutectic solvents that consisted of choline chloride and biomass-derived polyols (ethylene glycol, glycerol, xylitol, and sorbitol). Choline chloride-glycerol (ChCl-Gly) pretreatment retained >90 % glucan from rice straw, even at high pretreatment severity (>4.2 severity factor). In addition, ChCl-Gly pretreatment fractionated 74 wt.% lignin and completely removed acetyl groups from xylan, which enhanced glucan digestibility from 21 % to 87 %. However, the ChCl-Gly deep eutectic solvent became deposited on the solids and limited cellulose accessibility to cellulase enzymes. A sodium carbonate wash was highly effective in removing the deposited ChCl-Gly from the pretreated solids and enhancing cellulase accessibility to cellulose. The simple production and biodegradability without interfering with glucan make ChCl-Gly a promising lignocellulose pretreatment agent. In addition, the ability to fractionate both lignin and sugars enables biorefineries to use the lignin as a co-product. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A combined pretreatment of NH4Cl impregnation and refining was developed to recover the fermentable sugars and improve the bioethanol yield. The xylose was recovered to decrease the cost of bioethanol production, moreover, the impregnation using nonmetal salt had little influence on the environment, and the energy consumption of the refining process was hugely reduced by the impregnation. The results showed that a high-temperature, short-time impregnation (170 °C, 10 min) led mainly to hemicelluloses degradation, where 97.4 % of the xylose was recovered from the impregnation liquor. 97.9 % of the cellulose in the refined solid substrate (SS) was converted to glucose by enzymatic hydrolysis, and 80.3 % of which was further fermented to bioethanol. The pretreatment energy efficiency was up to 260 g sugar/MJ, nearly three times higher than that using H2O impregnation and refining. Finally, the bioethanol yield (BY) and the xylose recovery reached to 189.75 and 150.95 g/kg wood, respectively. © 2021

AB  - Production of biofuels such as ethanol from non-grain crops may contribute to alleviating the global energy crisis and reducing the potential threat to food security. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is a commercial crop with high biomass yield. Breeding of starch-rich tobacco plants may provide alternative raw materials for the production of fuel ethanol. We cloned the small subunit gene NtSSU of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (NtAGPase), which controls starch biosynthesis in tobacco, and constructed a plant expression vector pCAMBIA1303-NtSSU. The NtSSU gene was overexpressed in tobacco upon Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation. Phenotypic analysis showed that overexpression of NtSSU gene promoted the accumulation of starch in tobacco leaves, and the content of starch in tobacco leaves increased from 17.5% to 41.7%. The growth rate and biomass yield of the transgenic tobacco with NtSSU gene were also significantly increased. The results revealed that overexpression of NtSSU gene could effectively redirect more photosynthesis carbon flux into starch biosynthesis pathway, which led to an increased biomass yield but did not generate negative effects on other agronomic traits. Therefore, NtSSU gene can be used as an excellent target gene in plant breeding to enrich starch accumulation in vegetative organs to develop new germplasm dedicated to fuel ethanol production. © 2021, Science Press.

AB  - Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) such as caproic, heptanoic, and caprylic acids are monocarboxylic acids, which can be used as precursor molecules to synthesize biodiesel, bioplastics, antimicrobials, and corrosion inhibitors. Anaerobic bacteria transform ethanol and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as acetate, butyrate, and valerate into MCFA through chain elongation. SCFA and MCFA production were evaluated in this study using two types of waste: apple waste (AW) and pumpkin waste (PW). Two kinds of PW, pumpkin pulp waste (PPW) and pumpkin skin waste (PSW), were used. AW and PW were first converted into a paste using a blender, and then into a leachate (liquid extract obtained from the paste) by adding an anaerobic mixed bacterial culture to the paste in a separate anaerobic chamber. The leachate containing SCFA was further transformed to MCFA using a Clostridium kluyveri augmented, especially enriched anaerobic mixed bacterial culture. The production of SCFA, MCFA and biogas was established for 75 days and analyzed throughout the experiment using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC), respectively. Bacteria incubated with AW produced significant amounts of SCFA (7.2 g l-1 of butyric acid) and MCFA (1.2 g l-1 of caproic acid). Bacteria incubated with PPW produced 4.4 g l-1 of butyric acid and 6.1 g l-1 of caproic acid, whereas, bacteria incubated with PSW showed lower amounts of SCFA (1.7 g l-1 of butyric acid) and MCFA (2.5 g l-1 of caproic acid). Clean energy in the form of biohydrogen (H2) constituted the highest proportion (75%) of the biogas composition. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Recyclable biocatalysts and high-efficiency lignocellulose deconstruction are the crucial factors for cost-effective conversion of biomass into biofuels and bioproducts. Acetic acid-based catalytic hydrolysis of grassy lignocellulosic biomass presents a promising application because of its effectivity, recyclability, and other environmentally friendly features. However, this treatment is not as effective on woody biomass, such as poplar. One way to improve conversion performance of this process is to integrate it with other effective processes, such as pretreating biomass with protic ionic liquids (PILs) that have been shown to effectively solubilize lignin in reducing the recalcitrance of biomass to enzymatic deconstruction. In this work, an integrated acetic acid based one-pot ethanolamine acetate pretreatment (HAc-[EOA][OAc]) was developed for the efficient depolymerization of poplar polysaccharides. The configuration simultaneously removed ∼88% hemicellulose and selectively extracted up to ∼46% of the lignin from lignocellulosic biomass. HAc-[EOA][OAc] pretreated poplar yielded over 80% enzyme-hydrolyzed glucose that was attributed to an increase in the accessible surface area of cellulose to the hydrolytic enzymes. Analysis of the cellulose crystallinity and thermal decomposition profiles revealed that all pretreated samples have a higher cellulose crystallinity, indicating that amorphous cellulose had been removed during pretreatment. Conductor like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) and Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) were used to provide insights into the mechanism of biomass pretreatment efficacy using both HAc and [EOA][OAc]. We found that a strong hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic misfit interaction between hemicellulose and HAc may explain the higher removal of hemicellulose during HAc pretreatment. Further, the close HSP values and COSMO-RS analysis indicate that [EOA][OAc] is a good lignin solvent, which leads to the higher delignification of biomass. This study demonstrates that the integration of IL with acid pretreatment is a promising strategy for conducting effective pretreatment on woody lignocellulose. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - To overcome the structural complexity and improve the bioconversion efficiency of Pennisetum purpureum into bioethanol or/and biomethane, the effects of ensiling pretreatment, NaOH pretreatment, and their combination on digestion performance and mass flow were comparatively investigated. The coproduction of bioethanol and biomethane showed that 65.2 g of ethanol and 102.6 g of methane could be obtained from 1 kg of untreated Pennisetum purpureum, and pretreatment had significant impacts on the production; however, there is no significant difference between the results of NaOH pretreatment and ensiling-NaOH pretreatment in terms of production improvement. Among them, 1 kg of ensiling-NaOH treated Pennisetum purpureum could yield 269.4 g of ethanol and 144.5 g of methane, with a respective increase of 313.2% and 40.8% compared to that from the untreated sample; this corresponded to the final energy production of 14.5 MJ, with the energy conversion efficiency of 46.8%. In addition, for the ensiling-NaOH treated Pennisetum purpureum, the energy recovery from coproduction (process III) was 98.9% higher than that from enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation only (process I) and 53.6% higher than that from anaerobic digestion only (process II). This indicated that coproduction of bioethanol and biomethane from Pennisetum purpureum after ensiling and NaOH pretreatment is an effective method to improve its conversion efficiency and energy output. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The cellulose dissolution is an essential pretreatment process for the chemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels. Here, the dissolution of a 36-chain Iβ cellulose model with a hexagonal cross-section (M36HCS) in water is analyzed by Molecular Dynamics (MD) with CHARMM36/TIP3P (C36/TIP3P) force field using gradual heating at 25 MPa. Our simulations showed that the dissolution of M36HCS starts to occur between 560 K and 600 K, which agrees with experimental observations. In our system, conditions near the critical point of water reveal that translational and rotational entropies decrease, while the low hydration level increases vibrational entropy. This investigation theoretically shows that C36/TIP3P adequately reproduces the dissolution of M36HCS even in high-pressure water as corroborated in reactors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass such as switchgrass can be converted to n-butanol using fermentation, which can be further processed into jet fuel. Traditional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation only converts sugars derived from switchgrass to ABE. Novel co-fermentation processes convert sugars and gas (CO2/H2) produced during fermentation into butanol, thus increasing ABE yields by 15.5% compared to traditional ABE fermentation. Herein, the environmental impact of a Switchgrass to Jet Fuel (STJ) pathway was assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA) from well-to-wake. LCAs were performed for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from jet fuel production via co-fermentation of sugars and gas for ideal and practical cases of ABE fermentation and seven other jet fuel pathways. The ideal case assumes 100% sugar recovery and 95% ABE yield. The practical case assumes 90% sugar recovery and an 80% ABE yield. Results are presented based on 100-year global warming potential (GWP) per MJ of jet fuel. Co-products were allocated using various methods. The increase in butanol yield via the co-fermentation technology reduced GWP-100 for the STJ pathway by 6.5% compared to traditional ABE fermentation. Similarly, the STJ pathway for the practical case with co-fermentation had 14.2%, 47.5%, 73.8%, and 44.4% less GWP-100 compared to HRJ, Fischer-Tropsch jet fuel from switchgrass, Fischer-Tropsch jet fuel from coal, and conventional petroleum jet fuel. The results demonstrate that the STJ pathway via co-fermentation has the potential to increase product yield while reducing GHG emissions compared to other jet fuel production pathways. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels is influenced by biomass composition and structure. Lignin and other cell wall phenylpropanoids, such as para-coumaric acid (pCA) and ferulic acid (FA), reduce cell wall sugar accessibility and hamper biochemical fuel production. Toward identifying the timing and key parameters of cell wall recalcitrance across different switchgrass genotypes, this study measured cell wall composition and lignin biosynthesis gene expression in three switchgrass genotypes, A4 and AP13, representing the lowland ecotype, and VS16, representing the upland ecotype, at three developmental stages [Vegetative 3 (V3), Elongation 4 (E4), and Reproductive 3 (R3)] and three segments (S1–S3) of the E4 stage under greenhouse conditions. A decrease in cell wall digestibility and an increase in phenylpropanoids occur across development. Compared with AP13 and A4, VS16 has significantly less lignin and greater cell wall digestibility at the V3 and E4 stages; however, differences among genotypes diminish by the R3 stage. Gini correlation analysis across all genotypes revealed that lignin and pCA, but also pectin monosaccharide components, show the greatest negative correlations with digestibility. Lignin and pCA accumulation is delayed compared with expression of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes, while FA accumulation coincides with expression of these genes. The different cell wall component accumulation profiles and gene expression correlations may have implications for system biology approaches to identify additional gene products with cell wall component synthesis and regulation functions. © Copyright © 2021 Saha, Lin, Thibivilliers, Xiong, Pan and Bartley.

AB  - The magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) model Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1 (Mgryph) is typically known for its capacity to produce magnetic nanoparticles with unique properties, namely, magnetosomes. However, the magnetosome fraction represents only around 4% of the total cell mass. Therefore, the downstream processing of Mgryph generates a substantial amount of under-utilized microbial biomass waste (MBW) rich in proteins and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which can be used, for example, as animal feed and biodegradable bioplastics, respectively. In this work, we have designed an integrated Mgryph-based biorefinery through the utilization of the MBW for the recovery of PHA and soluble proteins using NaClO extraction, revealing that poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) is produced with a relative abundance of 99:1 mol % (3HB/3HV). We have further upgraded PHA into crotonic acid using pyrolysis, which can be used in adhesive and biofuel manufacturing. The effect of the MBW concentration used in the NaClO extraction step (10, 30, and 50 g MBW L-1) was evaluated to determine PHA recovery yields, purity, and purification factor, as well as the thermal stability and fraction of volatile components. The condition using 10 g MBW L-1 was the best among those tested with 51.3 ± 0.14% PHA content in the extract, 97.8% extraction yield, and 2.93 purification factor. The thermogravimetric analysis of PHA extracts from Mgryph showed a degradation range between 232 and 292 °C and a purity of up to 73 ± 4%. Under optimal extraction conditions (10 g MBW L-1), 53.3% of the total cellular protein was recovered. Analysis of products from isothermal pyrolysis of PHA extracts at 300 °C yielded up to 86.0 ± 1.5% of crotonic acid. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to extract PHA from Mgryph, thus representing a benchmark for future optimization studies for PHA recovery in this microorganism. Moreover, this work explores the development of an integrated Mgryph-based biorefinery for valorizing MBW into added value biochemicals, which can be used in a wide range of applications, thus representing an opportunity to improve the efficiency of magnetosome production toward the development of sustainable bioprocesses. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Innovative fluorescence security technologies for paper-based information are still highly pursued nowadays because data leakage and indelibility have become serious economic and social problems. Herein, we report a novel transient bio-fluorochromic supramolecular co-assembly mediated by a hydrolytic enzyme (ALP: alkaline phosphatase) towards rewritable security printing. A co-assembly based on the designed tetrabranched cationic diethynylanthracene monomer tends to be formed by adding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the biofuel. The resulting co-assembly possesses a time-encoded bio-fluorochromic feature, upon successively hydrolyzing ATP with ALP and re-adding new batches of ATP. On this basis, the dynamic fluorescent properties of this time-encoded co-assembly system have been successfully enabled in rewritable security patternsviaan inkjet printing technique, providing fascinating potential for fluorescence security materials with a biomimetic mode. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Biofuel cells (BFCs) that produce electrical energy from organic resources through enzymatic reactions have been attracting significant attention. Owing to the high electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), their modification on the electrode surface of a BFC is expected to increase the current, and their high specific surface area may be useful in increasing the power output. Previously, we constructed a biocathode by immobilizing multicopper oxidase from Pyrobaculum aerophilum (McoP) with a carbon nanotube binding peptide (CBP) sequence on the CNTs. This resulted in higher current densities than when using enzymes without CBP sequences. However, owing to the randomly stacked CNTs on the surface of the electrodes, their conductive properties were impaired and performance as biocathodes was poor. Herein, we constructed a biocathode in which single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) were oriented one-dimensionally and McoP is immobilized on the surface of an SWNCT via CBP. The current density was successfully increased by two-fold by orienting the CNTs and orienting and immobilizing McoP on their surfaces. This technology provides insights into the development of biodevices with controlled orientation of both the SWCNTs and enzymes immobilized on their surfaces. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - One of the anaerobic digestion process products in an agricultural biogas plant is digestate (digested pulp). Large quantities of digestate generated in the process of biogas production all over the world require proper management. Fertilization is the main management of this substrate, so it is essential to look for new alternatives. The work aims to determine and discuss the possibilities of using digestate solid fraction (DSF) for pellets as biofuel production. Pellets from DSF alone and pellets with sawdust, grain straw additives were analyzed. The lower heating value (LHV) based on the dry matter for all analyzed pellets ranged from 19,164 kJ.kg-1 to 19,879 kJ.kg-1. The ash content was similar for all four samples and ranged from 3.62% to 5.23%. This value is relatively high, which is related to the degree of fermentation in the anaerobic digestion process. The results showed that the DSF substrate after the anaerobic digestion process still has energy potential. Analyzing those results, it seems that DSF can be a highly valuable substrate for solid biofuels production. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Low-acid hydrothermal (LAH) fractionation conditions were optimized for the effective degradation of hemicellulose from pine wood (Pinus densiflora). The hemicellulosic sugar yield was maximized at 82.5% when the pine wood was fractionated at 190 °C, with 0.5 wt.% of sulfuric acid, and for 10 min. Consecutively, acidified heat treatment with zinc chloride and solvent extraction with ethyl acetate were carried out for the recovery of bio-based platform chemicals, such as furfural and acetic acid, from liquid hydrolysate through liquid–liquid extraction (LLE). Overall, 61.5% of xylose was decomposed into furfural, and the yield of acetic acid was 62.3% and furfural 66.1%. After LAH fractionation, 64.8% of the solid remained and was pelletized. The pellets showed excellent fuel characteristics, i.e., significant ash rejection (74.5%) and high calorific values (4770 kcal/kg), and the precursors of NOx and SOx also decreased by up to 60.0% and 71.4%, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The present study aims to improve biomass and biochemical constituents, especially lipid production of Anabaena variabilis and Nostoc muscorum by formulating an optimal growth condition using various concentrations of nutrients (NO3−, PO43− and CO32−) for biodiesel production. The sup-plementation of the three nutrients by +50% showed the maximum dry weight and biomass produc-tivity, while the macromolecule contents were varied. The depletion of N-NO3− by 50% N-NO3− showed the maximum lipid yield (146.67 mg L−1) in A. variabilis and the maximum carbohydrate contents (285.33 mg L−1) in N. muscorum with an increase of 35% and 30% over control of the syn-thetic medium, respectively. However, variation in P-PO43− and C-CO32− showed insignificant improving results for all biochemical compositions in both cyanobacteria. A. variabilis was the superior species for lipid and protein accumulation; however, N. muscorum showed the maximum carbohydrate content. Accordingly, A. variabilis was selected for biodiesel production. In A. variabilis, −50% N-NO3− resulted in 35% higher lipid productivity compared to the control. Furthermore, the fatty acid profile and biodiesel quality-related parameters have improved under this condition. This study has revealed the strategies to improve A. variabilis lipid productivity for biodiesel production for small-scale in vitro application in terms of fuel quality under low nitrate levels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The alpha-proteobacterium Zymomonas mobilis is a promising biofuel producer, based on its native metabolism that efficiently converts sugars to ethanol. Therefore, it has a high potential for industrial-scale biofuel production. Two previous studies suggested that Z. mobilis strain Zm4 might not be monoploid. However, a systematic analysis of the genome copy number is still missing, in spite of the high potential importance of Z. mobilis. To get a deep insight into the ploidy level of Z. mobilis and its regulation, the genome copy numbers of three strains were quantified. The analyses revealed that, during anaerobic growth, the lab strain Zm6, the Zm6 type strain obtained from DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms), and the lab strain Zm4, have copy numbers of 18.9, 22.3 and 16.2, respectively, of an origin-adjacent region. The copy numbers of a terminus-adjacent region were somewhat lower with 9.3, 15.8, and 12.9, respectively. The values were similar throughout the growth curves, and they were only slightly downregulated in late stationary phase. During aerobic growth, the copy numbers of the lab strain Zm6 were much higher with around 40 origin-adjacent copies and 17 terminus-adjacent copies. However, the cells were larger during aerobic growth, and the copy numbers per μm3 cell volume were rather similar. Taken together, this first systematic analysis revealed that Z. mobilis is polyploid under regular laboratory growth conditions. The copy number is constant during growth, in contrast to many other polyploid bacteria. This knowledge should be considered in further engineering of the strain for industrial applications. © Copyright © 2021 Fuchino, Wasser and Soppa.

AB  - Agave bagasse is a residual biomass in the production of the alcoholic beverage tequila, and therefore, it is a promising raw material in the development of biorefineries using hot compressed water pretreatment (hydrothermal processing). Surfactants application has been frequently reported as an alternative to enhance monomeric sugars production efficiency and as a possibility to reduce the enzyme loading required. Nevertheless, the surfactant’s action mechanisms in the enzymatic hydrolysis is still not elucidated. In this work, hot compressed water pretreatment was applied on agave bagasse for biomass fractionation at 194 °C in isothermal regime for 30 min, and the effect of non-ionic surfactants (Tween 20, Tween 80, Span 80, and Polyethylene glycol (PEG 400)) was studied as a potential enhancer of enzymatic saccharification of hydrothermally pretreated solids of agave bagasse (AGB). It was found that non-ionic surfactants show an improvement in the conversion yield of cellulose to glucose (100%) and production of glucose (79.76 g/L) at 15 FPU/g glucan, the highest enhancement obtained being 7% regarding the control (no surfactant addition), using PEG 400 as an additive. The use of surfactants allows improving the production of fermentable sugars for the development of second-generation biorefineries. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Brown algae is a kind of renewable resource for biofuels production. As the major component of carbohydrate in the cell walls of brown algae, alginate can be degraded into unsaturated monosaccharide by exo-type alginate lyases, then converted into 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate (DEH) by a non-enzyme reaction, which is an important raw material for the preparation of bioethanol. In our research, a novel exo-type alginate lyase, VsAly7D, belonging to the PL7 family was isolated from marine bacterium Vibrio sp. QY108 and recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified VsAly7D demonstrated the highest activity at 35◦C, whereas it still maintained 46.5% and 83.1% of its initial activity at 20◦C and 30◦C, respectively. In addition, VsAly7D exhibited the maximum activity under alkaline conditions (pH 8.0), with the simultaneously remaining stability between pH 8.0 and 10.0. Compared with other reported exo-type enzymes, VsAly7D could efficiently degrade alginate, poly-β-D-mannuronate (polyM) and poly-α-L-guluronate (polyG) with highest specific activities (663.0 U/mg, 913.6 U/mg and 894.4 U/mg, respectively). These results showed that recombinant VsAly7D is a suitable tool enzyme for unsaturated alginate monosaccharide preparation and holds great promise for producing bioethanol from brown algae. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) is a native perennial warm-season (C4) grass common in North American prairies. With its high biomass yield and abiotic stress tolerance, there is a high potential of developing prairie cordgrass for conservation practices and as a dedicated bioenergy crop for sustainable cellulosic biofuel production. However, as with many other undomes-ticated grass species, little information is known about the genetic diversity or population structure of prairie cordgrass natural populations as compared to their ecotypic and geographic adaptation in North America. In this study, we sampled and characterized a total of 96 prairie cordgrass natural populations with 9315 high quality SNPs from a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. The natural populations were collected from putative remnant prairie sites throughout the Midwest and Eastern USA, which are the major habitats for prairie cordgrass. Partitioning of genetic variance using SNP marker data revealed significant variance among and within populations. Two potential gene pools were identified as being associated with ploidy levels, geographical separation, and climatic separation. Geographical factors such as longitude and altitude, and environmental factors such as annual temperature, annual precipitation, temperature of the warmest month, precipitation of the wettest month, precipitation of Spring, and precipitation of the wettest month are important in affecting the intraspecific distribution of prairie cordgrass. The divergence of prairie cordgrass natural populations also provides opportunities to increase breeding value of prairie cordgrass as a bioenergy and conservation crop. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A recent trend in sustainable bioethanol production is the use of agricultural waste or food waste as an inexpensive and the most available feedstock. Bread waste is the major food waste that could be successfully used for the production of bioethanol. The aim of this study was to optimize ethanol production by the response surface methodology (RSM) using waste bread hydrolysate. Waste bread hydrolysate was obtained using crude hydrolytic enzymes that produce bacterial isolate Hymenobacter sp. CKS3. The influence of time of fermentation (24-72 h) and waste brewer's yeast inoculum (1-4 %) on ethanol production was studied. The optimal conditions, obtained by central composite design (CCD), were 48.6 h of fermentation and 2.85 % of inoculum. Under these conditions, a maximum of 2.06 % of ethanol concentration was reached. The obtained ethanol concentration was in good correlation, coefficient of 0.858, with yeast cell yield. The results obtained in this study imply that waste bread hydrolysate could be used as a biomass source for biofuel production with multiple benefits relating to environmental protection, reduction of production costs, and saving fossil fuels. © 2021 Serbian Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, a new green integrated process for biodiesel ester production was developed, consisting of the enzymatic transesterification of acid oil from macaúba palm tree (Acrocomia aculeata) catalyzed by dry fermented solid (DFS) with lipase activity, which was obtained from solid-state fermentation (SSF) of macaúba cake. Analysis of statistical experimental designs showed that nitrogen supplementation of macaúba cake improved production of lipases displaying esterification capacity by Rhizomucor miehei. The conditions chosen to produce R. miehei DFS were cake supplementation with 2 wt% urea, 60 wt% of initial moisture during 48 h of fermentation at 40°C. DFS showed, by zymography assays, at least one enzyme that was different from those that are present in the commercial lipase of R. miehei. Furthermore, DFS was used in transesterification reactions between macaúba acid oil and alcohol (methanol or ethanol), and the ester content obtained was 92%. This is the first time that this integrated process using low-cost biocatalysts and a low-value oil derived from the processing of the same fruit was used for biodiesel ester production, reducing costs and logistic constraints, and optimizing the raw material utilization. © 2021 AOCS.

AB  - Marafiviruses are capable of persistent infection in a range of plants that have importance to the agriculture and biofuel industries. Although the genomes of a few of these viruses have been studied in-depth, the composition and processing of the polyproteins produced from their main ORFs have not. The Marafivirus polyprotein consists of essential proteins that form the viral replicase, as well as structural proteins for virus assembly. It has been proposed that Marafiviruses code for cysteine proteases within their polyproteins, which act as endopeptidases to autocatalytically cleave the polyprotein into functional domains. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that Marafivirus endopeptidases may have deubiquitinating activity, which has been shown to enhance viral replication by downregulating viral protein degradation by the ubiquitin (Ub) proteasomal pathway as well as tampering with cell signaling associated with innate antiviral responses in other positive-sense ssRNA viruses. Here, we provide the first evidence of cysteine proteases from six different Marafiviruses that harbor deubiquitinating activity and reveal intragenus differences toward Ub linkage types. We also examine the structural basis of the endopeptidase/deubiquitinase from the Marafivirus type member, maize rayado fino virus. Structures of the enzyme alone and bound to Ub reveal marked structural rearrangements that occur upon binding of Ub and provide insights into substrate specificity and differences that set it apart from other viral cysteine proteases. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

AB  - Wearable sensors for non-invasive monitoring constitute a growing technology in many industrial fields, such as clinical or sport monitoring. However, one of the main challenges in wearable sensing is the development of bioelectrodes via the use of flexible and stretchable materials capable of maintaining conductive and biocompatible properties simultaneously. In this study, chitosan-carbon black (CH-CB) membranes have been synthesized using a straightforward and versatile strategy and characterized in terms of their composition and their electrical and mechanical properties. In this sense, CH-CB membranes showed good conductivity and mechanical resistance thanks to the presence of carbon black, which decreases the insulating behavior of chitosan, while flexibility and biocompatibility are maintained due to the dual composition of the membrane. Thus, flexible and biocompatible conductive bioelectrodes have been developed by the combined use of CH and CB without the use of toxic reagents, extra energy input, or long reaction times. The membranes were modified using the enzymes Glucose Oxidase and Laccase in order to develop flexible and biocompatible bioelectrodes for enzymatic glucose biofuel cells (BFCs) and glucose detection. A BFC assembled using the flexible bioelectrodes developed was able to deliver 15 µW cm−2, using just 1 mM glucose as biofuel, and up to 21.3 µW·cm−2 with higher glucose concentration. Additionally, the suitability of the CH-CB membranes to be used as a glucose sensor in a linear range from 100 to 600 µM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 76 µM has been proven. Such demonstrations for energy harvesting and sensing capabilities of the developed membrane pave the way for their use in wearable sensing and energy harvesting technologies in the clinical field due to their good mechanical, electrical, and biocompatible properties. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Salix (willow) is a well-known coppice plant that has been used as a source for bioenergy for decades. With recent developments in changing from a fossil-based to a circular bioeconomy, greater interest has been orientated towards willow as a potential source of biomass for transport biofuels. This has created increasing interest for breeding strategies to produce interesting genotypic and phenotypic traits in different willow varieties. In the present study, 326 genetically distinct clones and several commercial varieties of S. viminalis were analyzed using complementary approaches including density, chemical, image, histochemical, and morphometric analyses. A systematic approach was adopted whereby the basal regions of harvested stems were separated and used in all studies to aid comparisons. Density analyses were performed on all clone individuals, and from the results, 20 individual plants representing 19 clones were selected for the more in-depth analyses (chemical, image analysis, histochemical, and morphometric). The absolute dry density of the clones selected varied between ca. 300 and 660 kg/m3 with less variation seen in the commercial S. viminalis varieties (ca. 450–520 kg/m3). Selected clones for chemical analysis showed the largest variation in glucose (47.3–60.1%; i.e., cellulose) and total sugar content, which ranged between ca. 61 and 77% and only ca. 16 and 22% for lignin. Image analyses of entire basal stem sections showed presence of tension wood in variable amounts (ca. 7–39%) with characteristic G-fibers containing cellulose-rich and non-lignified gelatinous layers. Several of the clones showing prominent tension wood also showed high glucose and total sugar content as well as low lignin levels. A morphometric approach using an optical fiber analyzer (OFA) for analyzing 1000 s (minimum 100,000 particles) of macerated fibers was evaluated as a convenient tool for determining the presence of tension wood in stem samples. Statistical analyses showed that for S. viminalis stems of the same density and thickness, the OFA approach could separate tension wood fibers from normal wood fibers by length but not fiber width. Results emphasized considerable variability between the clones in the physical and chemical approaches adopted, but that a common aspect for all clones was the occurrence of tension wood. Since tension wood with G-fibers and cellulose-rich G-layers represents an increased source of readily available non-recalcitrant cellulose for biofuels, S. viminalis breeding programs should be orientated towards determining factors for its enhancement. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Clostridium carboxidivorans converts syngas into industrial alcohols like hexanol, but titers may be limited by product toxicity. Investigation of IC50 at 30 °C (17.5 mM) and 37 °C (11.8 mM) revealed increased hexanol tolerance at lower temperatures. To avoid product toxicity, oleyl alcohol was added as an extraction solvent, increasing hexanol production nearly 2.5-fold to 23.9 mM (2.4 g/L) at 30 °C. This titer exceeds the concentration that is acutely toxic in the absence of a solvent, confirming the hypothesis that current hexanol production is limited by product toxicity. The solvent however had no positive effect at 37 °C. Furthermore, C. carboxidivorans cell membranes adapted to the higher temperature by incorporating more saturated fatty acids, but surprisingly not to hexanol. Corn oil and sunflower seed oil were tested as alternative, inexpensive extraction solvents. Hexanol titers were similar with all solvents, but oleyl alcohol achieved the highest extraction efficiency. © 2021

AB  - In this work, the biomass productivity for biorefinery products and growth curves of three autochthonous microalgae collected in different reservoirs (“Scenedesmus sp.” (SSP), mixture of Scenedesmus sp., Chlorella minutissima, Chlorellas sp. and Nannochloropsis sp. named “La Orden” (LO) consortium and Chlorella minutissima named “Charca Brovales” (CB) consortium) were studied in a 5.5 L column laboratory photobioreactor. Two different culture media, Arnon culture (AM) and an agriculture fertilizer-based liquid medium (FM), have been used to evaluate the growth effect of the microalgae; it was found that the medium has a clear effect on the biomass productivity and growth rate, which ranged between 0.26–0.498 g L−1 d−1 and 0.288–0.864 d−1, respectively. In general, the elemental analysis and higher heating value of microalgae biomass for the three species were independent of the culture medium used for its growth, while their lipids and sugars content depended upon the species type and culture medium used in the cultivation. “La Orden” microalga was selected (given its best adaption to the climatic conditions) to study the biomass productivity and growth rate in two exterior photobioreactors (100 L column and 400 L flat panel), using FM as a medium, obtaining values of 0.116–0.266 g L−1 d−1 and 0.360–0.312 d−1, respectively. An automation and control system was designed to operate the exterior photobioreactors pilot plant. The lipid content of this microalga in these photobioreactors was lower than in the laboratory one, with a fatty acids profile with predominantly palmitic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. Also, the fresh biomass collected from these photobioreactors was studied in a batch type digestion process for biogas production, obtaining a CH4 yield of 296 ± 23 L CH4 kgVSS−1 added with a reduction in percentage of COD and vs. of 50 ± 1% and 50 ± 1.7%, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Anaerobic fungi are prime candidates for the conversion of agricultural waste products to biofuels. Despite the increasing interest in these organisms, their growth requirements and metabolism remain largely unknown. The isolation of five strains of anaerobic fungi and their identification as Neocallimastix cameroonii, Caecomyces spec., Orpinomyces joyonii, Pecoramyces ruminantium, and Khoyollomyces ramosus, is described. The phylogeny supports the reassignment of Neocallimastix californiae and Neocallimastix lanati to Neocallimastix cameroonii and points towards the redesignation of Cyllamyces as a species of Caecomyces. All isolated strains including strain A252, which was described previously as Aestipascuomyces dubliciliberans, were further grown on different carbon sources and the produced metabolites were analyzed; hydrogen, acetate, formate, lactate, and succinate were the main products. Orpinomyces joyonii was lacking succinate production and Khoyollomyces ramosus was not able to produce lactate under the studied conditions. The results further suggested a sequential production of metabolites with a preference for hydrogen, acetate, and formate. By comparing fungal growth on monosaccharides or on the straw, a higher hydrogen production was noticed on the latter. Possible reactions to elevated sugar concentrations by anaerobic fungi are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Nanoparticles have become omnipresent as they have distinctively diverse properties from their bulk counterparts. They find a considerable research interest in numerous biological, biomedical, biopharmaceutical, and biochemical applications. The productivity and structure of nanoparticles are deeply reliant on the method used for their synthesis. The classical hydrothermal method needs massive and expensive temperature controller instruments, a huge amount of reagents, and specific autoclaves for their synthesis. With this motivation, herein, an automated, integrated, and miniaturized thermal monitoring system has been designed and developed for producing nanoparticle-on-chip (NoC) in a microfluidic platform. Herein, Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized. The device comprises a microcontroller, self-designed switching circuit, cartridge heater, and thermocouple. The device, with dimensions 78 × 75 × 40 mm3, has benefits such as portability, easy-to-use, amenability to geotagged data logging, and inexpensive. The device showcased the temperature sensitivity of ± 0.5 °C. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-based microfluidic device, with a suitable microreactor, was fabricated using the CO2 laser ablation technique. ZnO nanoparticles were successfully synthesized at 95 °C within 60 min and were subjected to several characterization techniques to manifest their crystographic, elemental, morphologic, and spectroscopic properties. As a proof-of-principle, the produced ZnO nanoparticles were validated for electrocatalytic sensing of hydrazine and uric acid, and as a catalyst in an enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (EBFC) to test its efficiency. The proposed microfluidic thermal system can be utilized for carrying out numerous temperature-based reactions and analyses. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Bioethanol gel is gaining more attention for clean cooking fuel as green technology and partial replacement of burning the biomass for cooking purposes. The conversion of tapioca flour wastes to bioethanol and its production to bioethanol gel have not been performed. Tapioca flour industrial wastes are rich in sugar, and promising for the low-cost biomass for bioethanol production. The production of bioethanol from cassava peels and cassava pomace (onggok) and its bioethanol gel formulation were performed in this study. The research was carried out by treating tapioca starch wastes with pretreatment and hydrolysis, continued by applying eight fermentation treatments, and the bioethanol yields were analyzed quantitatively. Then, the bioethanol gel was formulated. The viscosity, calorific value, burning time, flame color, and ash content of the bioethanol gel were analyzed. It can be concluded that cassava-based industrial wastes were successfully converted to bioethanol with a 35% yield resulting in a 25% bioethanol concentration at a 2.64 g/L per h conversion rate. The efficiency of bioconversion was 86%, and reflux column distillation could increase the bioethanol concentration to 92%. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was an effective gelling agent and improved the viscosity at 1.338 mPa.s and burning time to 184 min. The ash content of all samples was lower than 5%, meaning that it is promising for further application as a household cookstove fuel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electricity constitutes a natural biophysical component that preserves tissue homeostasis and modulates many biological processes, including the repair of damaged tissues. Wound healing involves intricate cellular events, such as inflammation, angiogenesis, matrix synthesis, and epithelialization whereby multiple cell types sense the environmental cues to rebuild the structure and functions. Here, we report that electricity auto-generating glucose-responsive enzymatic-biofuel-cell (EBC) skin patch stimulates the wound healing process. Rat wounded-skin model and in vitro cell cultures showed that EBC accelerated wound healing by modulating inflammation while stimulating angiogenesis, fibroblast fuctionality and matrix synthesis. Of note, EBC-activated cellular bahaviors were linked to the signalings involved with calcium influx, which predominantly dependent on the mechanosensitive ion channels, primarily Piezo1. Inhibition of Piezo1-receptor impaired the EBC-induced key functions of both fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the wound healing. This study highlights the significant roles of electricity played in wound healing through activated mechanosensitive ion channels and the calcium influx, and suggests the possibility of the electricity auto-generating EBC-based skin patch for use as a wound healing device. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chlorella vulgaris is a popular microalga used for biofuel production; nevertheless, it possesses a strong cell wall that hinders the extraction of molecules, especially lipids within the cell wall. For tackling this issue, we developed an efficient and cost-effective method for optimal lipid extraction. Microlaga cell disruption by acid hydrolysis was investigated comparing different temperatures and reaction times; after hydrolysis, lipids were extracted with n-hexane. The best recoveries were obtained at 140°C for 90 min. The microalgae were then analyzed by an untargeted approach based on liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry, providing the tentative identification of 28 fatty acids. First, a relative quantification on the untargeted data was performed using peak area as a surrogate of analyte abundance. Then, a targeted quantitative method was validated for the tentatively identified fatty acids, in terms of recovery (78-100%), intra- and interday relative standard deviations (&lt;10 and &lt;9%, respectively) and linearity (R2&gt; 0.98). The most abundant fatty acids were palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and stearic acids. © 2021 The Authors. Journal of Separation Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Many studies have focused on effective ways to exploit enzyme immobilization on an electrode surface to help improve the performance of enzymatic electrochemical biosensors. Herein, a novel glucose sensor was fabricated by immobilizing glucose oxidase (GOx) onruthenium-based conjugated polymer (CP) and metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites. This has not only reduced the applied potential to 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), but also improved the effective surface area for enzyme immobilization.PPG@Ru@UiO-66-NH2 was tailored by controlled chemical synthesis from a pre-synthesized water-soluble conjugated polymer (poly(N-phenylglycine)) and metal-organic framework (UiO-66-NH2). The resulting nanocomposites were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The PPG@Ru@UiO-66-NH2/GOx coated electrodedisplayed a linear measurementrange for glucose from 1 mM to 10 mM, with a sensitivity of 45.92 μA ⋅ mM−1cm−1 and limit of detection of5 μM((Formula presented.)). Furthermore, the practical application of the fabricatedglucosesensor was tested in simulative blood samples with satisfactoryaccuracy. This approach alsoopens a new door for applications regarding both enzymatic electrochemical biosensors and enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The reverse osmosis system is one of the most advanced membrane-based water treatment technologies that can convert a variety of wastewater into drinking and industrial water. However, it has major drawbacks, including the production of a large amount of reject stream that contains concentrated nutrients. Microalgae are well-known for their rapid growth and ability to consume excessive nutrients very efficiently under a variety of wastewater conditions. In this study, a locally isolated microalga, Chlorella sorokiniana KNUA071, was cultivated in reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) obtained from a municipal wastewater reclamation facility that contained high levels of nutrients, ion, and metal elements. The aim was to investigate the potential of this microalga to be used in ROC treatments and the related applications of its biomass. Results showed that the C. sorokiniana KNUA071 could successfully remove 91.9% of total nitrogen (TN), 97% of total phosphorus, 98% of Mn, 100% of Al, 64% of Zn, 62% of Co, and 50% of Ni within 8 days, yielding a biomass productivity of 0.9 g dry weight L−1. This study also compared the results obtained from the Desmodesmus sp. KNUA024, which was used in the treatment of primary settled wastewater (PS) in our previously research, and was found to remove only 53.5% of TN in 8 days. C. sorokiniana KNUA071 biomass cultivated in the ROC had ~13.3% of lipid content while its biomass grown in the PS had ~28.2% of lipid content. The lipid contents of Desmodesmus sp. KNUA024 grown in the ROC and PS were ~29.3% and ~27.1%, respectively. Our findings suggest that microalgal cultivation could be employed as an effective strategy to remove nutrients and metals from ROC and at the same time produce biofuel from the lipids accumulated in the algal biomass. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We aimed to produce simultaneously biosurfactants and lipases in solid state fermentation (SSF) using Aspergillus niger, followed by the use of the fermented media on the bioremediation of oily contaminated soil, in order to valuate agro industrial residuals and reduce the contamination. The biocompounds were produced using wheat bran and corncob (80:20), 5% of soybean oil and 0.5% of sugar cane molasses in SSF for 4 d, producing 4.58 ± 0.69 UE of emulsifying activity and 7.77 ± 1.52 U of lipolytic activity. This fermented media was used in the bioremediation of a 20% biodiesel contaminated soil, evaluating for 90 d microbial growth, contaminant degradation, and production of lipases and biosurfactants in soils. Six experimental strategies (natural attenuation; biostimulation + bioaugmentation + biocompounds; biostimulation + biosurfactant; biocompounds extract; biostimulation; adsorption of contaminant) were realized. The highest degradation of contaminant was verified in 90 d, of 74.40 ± 1.76%, and the production of biosurfactants and lipases in situ in the soil was found in 30 d (6.02 ± 0.24% of reduction in surface tension and 6.62 ± 0.17 UL of lipid activity in soil) for the same experiment (biostimulation + bioaugmentation + biocompounds). The addition of biostimulation + biosurfactant promotes higher biodegradation (66.00 ± 0.92%) of the contaminant than the biocompounds extract (59.58 ± 0.34%). The use of a solid fermented culture medium containing both biocompounds was feasible for the treatment of contaminants, demonstrating the potential for environmental application without the need for purification processes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Gas fermentation processes have attracted considerable attention in recent years as they hold high potential for capturing and converting C1 waste gases into a range of biofuels and commodity chemicals. The production of solvents in gas fermentation is typically achieved by exploiting the solventogenic metabolism of acetogenic cultures, which is generally triggered upon exposure to stressful conditions, e.g. low pH. Although the oxidoreduction potential (ORP) is a well-known trigger of the cellular stress response, it has been scarcely investigated as a process control parameter in gas fermentation. Thus, this study focused on evaluating the potential of ORP control strategies for boosting the productivity of ethanol by exploiting the metabolic response to oxidative stress of acetogenic cultures. The dynamics of the redox cofactor pool and ratio as a function of the extracellular ORP and other operational parameters were also studied by monitoring the intracellular levels of the redox cofactor NADH/NAD+. The results showed that increasing the ORP to oxidizing conditions using dilute H2O2 triggered a 3.7-fold increase in the specific ethanol productivity, from 0.63 ± 0.04 mmol.gCDW-1 h-1 at an ORP of -210 mV to 2.32 ± 0.19 mmol gCDW-1 h-1 at 160 mV. Additionally, the concentration and product selectivity towards ethanol also increased considerably due to the partial inhibition of the chain elongation under oxidative stress. Boost in ethanol productivity and inhibition of the chain elongation were both found to be driven by the presence of H2O2 rather than by the ORP per se. Studying the profile of the redox cofactors revealed a highly dynamic nature in the pool and ratio of NADH/NAD+ as a function of the specific uptake rate and the ratio of acetate-to-ethanol, respectively. The latter was explained by analyzing the thermodynamics of the aldehyde:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR) pathway, which showed that the intrinsic thermodynamic limitation of this pathway imposes a high Fdred/Fdox ratio (>88 % of reduced ferredoxin) while forcing a highly dynamic NADH/NAD+ ratio in order to maintain the thermodynamic drive in the forward direction. The dynamics of the NADH/NAD+ ratio were also found to be significantly affected by the oxidative stress triggered by dilute H2O2, which confirmed the involvement of the AOR pathway in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization significantly affects soil extracellular oxidases, agents responsible for decomposition of slow turnover and recalcitrant soil organic carbon (SOC; e.g., lignin), and consequently influences soil carbon sequestration capacity. However, it remains unclear how soil oxidases mediate SOC sequestration under N fertilization, and whether these effects co-vary with plant type (e.g., bioenergy crop species). Using a spatially explicit design and intensive soil sampling strategy under three fertilization treatments in switchgrass (SG: Panicum virgatum L.) and gamagrass (GG: Tripsacum dactyloides L.) croplands, we quantified the activities of polyphenolic oxidase (PHO), peroxidase (PER), and their sum associated with recalcitrant C acquisition (OX). The fertilization treatments included no N fertilizer input (NN), low N input (LN: 84 kg N ha−1 year−1 in urea), and high N input (HN: 168 kg N ha−1 year−1 in urea). Besides correlations between soil oxidases and SOC (formerly published), both descriptive and geostatistical approaches were applied to evaluate the effects of N fertilization and crop type on soil oxidases activities and their spatial distributions. Results showed significantly negative correlations between soil oxidase activities and SOC across all treatments. The negative relationship of soil oxidases and SOC was also evident under N fertilization. First, LN significantly depressed oxidases in both mean activities and spatial heterogeneity, which corresponded to increased SOC in SG (though by 5.4%). LN slightly influenced oxidases activities and their spatial heterogeneity, consistent with insignificant changes of SOC in GG. Second, HN showed trends of decrease in soil oxidase activities, which aligned with the significantly enhanced SOC in both croplands. Overall, this study demonstrated that soil oxidase activities acted as sensitive and negative mediators of SOC sequestration in bioenergy croplands and optimizing fertilizer use particularly in switchgrass cropland can improve for both carbon sequestration and environmental benefit. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Synthetic microbial communities have the potential to enable new platforms for bioproduction of biofuels and biopharmaceuticals. However, using engineered communities is often assumed to be difficult because of anticipated challenges in establishing and controlling community composition. Cross-feeding between microbial auxotrophs has the potential to facilitate coculture growth and stability through a mutualistic ecological interaction. We assessed cross-feeding between 13 Escherichia coli amino acid auxotrophs paired with a leucine auxotroph of Bacillus megaterium. We developed a minimal medium capable of supporting the growth of both bacteria and used the media to study coculture growth of the 13 interspecies pairs of auxotrophs in batch and continuous culture, as well as on semi-solid media. In batch culture, 8 of 13 pairs of auxotrophs were observed to grow in coculture. We developed a new metric to quantify the impact of cross-feeding on coculture growth. Six pairs also showed long-term stability in continuous culture, where coculture growth at different dilution rates highlighted differences in cross-feeding amongst the pairs. Finally, we found that cross-feeding-dependent growth on semi-solid media is highly stringent and enables identification of the most efficient pairs. These results demonstrate that cross-feeding is a viable approach for controlling community composition within diverse synthetic communities. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Rhizopus oryzae lipase immobilised onto differently functionalised polymethacrylate (Purolite®) and magnetite superparamagnetic supports was assessed as a catalyst for biodiesel production with pomace oil. The presence of surface hydrocarbon chains increased the operational stability of the biocatalysts supported on Purolite® and superparamagnetic particles up to 9 and 2 times, respectively. By contrast, the presence of functional groups had no effect on the initial transesterification rate, which was twice higher with the lipase immobilised onto Purolite®. Also, functionalising Purolite® with epoxide and octadecyl groups led to the highest biodiesel and volumetric productivity. This biocatalyst with other substrates including makauba, jatropha, waste cooking oil, and microbial oil, led to similar initial reaction rates. However, simply raising substrate acidity from 0.5 to 2% increased the operational stability of the biocatalysts 15 times. A synergistic effect between acyl-acceptor concentration and substrate acidity was observed. The transesterification reaction was successfully scaled up to 50 mL. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Although lignocellulose is the most abundant and renewable natural resource for biofuel production, its use remains under exploration because of its highly recalcitrant structure. Its deconstruction into sugar monomers is mainly driven by carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). To develop highly efficient and fast strategies to discover biomass-degrading enzymes for biorefinery applications, an enrichment process combined with integrative omics approaches was used to identify new CAZymes. The lignocellulolytic-enriched mangrove microbial community (LignoManG) established on sugarcane bagasse (SB) was enriched with lignocellulolytic bacteria and fungi such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota. These microbial communities were able to degrade up to 55 % of the total SB, indicating the production of lignocellulolytic enzymes. Metagenomic analysis revealed that the LignoManG harbors 18.042 CAZyme sequences such as of cellulases, hemicellulases, carbohydrate esterases, and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase. Similarly, our metaproteomic analysis depicted several enzymes from distinct families of different CAZy families. Based on the LignoManG data, a xylanase (coldXynZ) was selected, amplified, cloned, expressed, and biochemically characterized. The enzyme displayed psicrofilic properties, with the highest activity at 15 °C, retaining 77 % of its activity when incubated at 0 °C. Moreover, molecular modeling in silico indicated that coldXynZ is composed of a TIM barrel, which is a typical folding found in the GH10 family, and displayed similar structural features related to cold-adapted enzymes. Collectively, the data generated in this study represent a valuable resource for lignocellulolytic enzymes with potential biotechnological applications. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Bioenergy crops provide enormous renewable biomass resources convertible for biofuel production, but lignocellulose recalcitrance fundamentally determines its enzymatic saccharification at high cost and low efficiency. In this study, total 30 diverse Miscanthus lignocellulose substrates were incubated with T. reesei strain to secret lignocellulose-degradation enzymes, and their major wall polymers features (cellulose crystallinity, hemicellulose arabinose and lignin H-monomer) were meanwhile examined with distinct impacts on the enzyme activities. Using characteristic Miscanthus (Msi62) de-lignin residue as inducing substrate with the reesei strain, this study detected that the Msi62-induced enzymes were of consistently higher enhancements on enzymatic saccharification of various lignocellulose residues examined in 17 grassy and woody bioenergy crops, particularly for the hemicellulose hydrolyses, compared to other two reesei-secreted cellulases and three commercial enzymes. Notably, based on SDS-gel protein separation profiling and LC-MS/MS analysis, the Msi62-induced enzymes consist of distinct cellulases (CBHI, BG, EGII) compositions and high-activity xylanases. Therefore, this study has demonstrated an applicable approach to achieve the optimal cellulases and xylanases cocktails that enable for low-costly and high-efficient enzymatic saccharification of diverse lignocellulose sources, providing a potential strategy for large-scale biofuel production in all major bioenergy crops. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The neutral lipids from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum are a valuable substance with a vital role in biofuel. Increasing the neutral lipid content of P. tricornutum through nutritional stress, such as nitrogen stress or genetic engineering, is often accompanied by reduced growth, which limits the development of microalgae-derived biofuels. Manganese is an essential trace element for plant growth and plays a key role in the light reactions of photosynthesis. This study aimed to determine whether Mn2+ can increase the neutral lipid content. We investigated the effects of Mn2+ on growth, neutral lipid content, photosynthetic pigment content, and fatty acid and photosynthesis-related gene expression and enzyme abundance in P. tricornutum. The algae were exposed to different concentrations of Mn2+ and monitored for growth and neutral lipid and photosynthetic pigment contents. After 7 days of culture, neutral lipid levels were markedly increased in algae exposed to 500 μg·L-1 Mn2+ (1.44 times higher than the control group without Mn2+). To confirm the molecular mechanism of this effect in P. tricornutum treated with Mn2+, the expression of key genes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway (ACC1, LACS1, AGPAT, MCAT) and C4 pathway (ME1, PEPCK1, PEPC, PPDK, CA) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of genes involved in these pathways reached their peak at a concentration of 500 μg·L-1 Mn2+, consistent with the change in neutral lipid content. Based on these results, we concluded that the neutral lipid content in P. tricornutum was enhanced by Mn2+, likely as a result of increased production of enzymes in the C4 pathway. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Crambe abyssinica is a non-edible crop able to adapt to adverse climatic conditions, arising as an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. With this objective, an eco-friendly route for biodiesel production from crambe oil by enzymatic transesterification was evaluated in order to maximize fatty acid methyl esters content. Response Surface Methodology and central composite design (two factors, three levels, one central point, two replicas) was used to obtain predictive models considering catalyst concentration and methanol:oil molar ratio as independent variables. Since the reaction was monitored overtime, a predictive model considering three independent variables (three factors, three levels) was also obtained. Enzymatic transesterification is a good alternative process to obtain high FAME yield, with 84 ± 5 wt % being obtained after 2 h using a methanol:oil molar ratio 6:1 and 8 wt% of enzyme, a value which predictably can increase to almost 99 wt% after 24 h. The results showed that the methanol:oil molar ratio and the enzyme's concentration considerably influence the FAME content during enzymatic catalyzed reaction. The polynomial regression models obtained can help to balance the concentration of enzyme and alcohol to improve FAME production and to predict the resulting yield. © 2021

AB  - This work aimed to study the hydrolysis of ionic liquid (IL) pretreated sugarcane tops (SCT) biomass with in-house developed IL-stable enzyme preparation, from a fungal isolate Aspergillus flavus PN3. Maximum reducing sugar yield (181.18 mg/g biomass) was obtained from tris (2-hydroxyethyl) methylammonium-methylsulfate ([TMA]MeSO4) pretreated biomass. Pretreatment parameters were optimized to attain enhanced sugar yield (1.57-fold). Functional mechanism of IL mediated pretreatment of SCT biomass was elucidated by SEM, XRD, FTIR and 1H NMR studies. Furthermore, nanobiocatalysts prepared by immobilization of enzyme preparation by covalent coupling on magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with amino-propyl triethoxysilane, were assessed for their hydrolytic efficacy and reusability. Nanobiocatalysts were examined by SEM and FTIR analysis for substantiation of immobilization. This is the first ever report of application of magnetic nanobiocatalysts for saccharification of IL-pretreated sugarcane tops biomass. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The presence of inhibitors is still an economic bottleneck that needs to be resolved in order to make the biorefineries feasible, requiring the development of technologies capable of improving their competitiveness in the biofuel marketplace. Soluble and insoluble lignin can impair the enzymatic hydrolysis process by inhibition, deactivation, and unproductive adsorption of enzymes. Washing the pretreated biomass or using lignin-blocking additives during saccharification could mitigate these negative effects in future biorefineries. Here, an investigation was performed of the combined mitigation processes, in terms of their technical and economic feasibility in an integrated first and second generation (1G2G) sugarcane biorefinery. Evaluation was made of the impacts of biomass washing and soybean protein addition, separately or in combination, on glucose yields for enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of high (liquor) and low (buffer) concentrations of soluble inhibitors/deactivators. Combining washing and soybean protein addition provided the highest glucose yields, with an increase of up to 50%. The effect of the mitigation processes could be explained by a combination of catalytic mechanisms acting on both soluble and insoluble lignin. In an industrial context, biomass washing (90 °C, 15% (w/w) solids, 3 steps) followed by soybean protein addition (12% (w/v) solids) provided a cost-competitive methodology for bioethanol production, with an estimated net present value of US$ 9.16 × 107, optimizing hydrolysis process in the 1G2G sugarcane biorefinery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an important renewable resource to produce biofuels, due to its abundance and high polysaccharide content. Bioconversion is generally achieved in two stages: (i) pre-treatment, to reduce biomass recalcitrance, and (ii) enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis into fermentable sugars. However, the key structural and chemical features of biomass which hinder enzymatic hydrolysis remains challenging to evaluate. In this study, we explored the effect of eight different pre-treatments on the enzymatic hydrolysis of a Eucalyptus sp. – a potential feedstock for biofuel production. The analytical data collected covered the mass fractions of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, the syringyl: guaiacyl (S/G) ratio of lignin, functional group determination, crystallinity index (CrI) and accessibility of cellulose. Enzymatic hydrolysis was then performed using an in-house optimised cellulolytic enzyme cocktail (either alone or supplemented with xylanase or laccase) to elucidate the key factors of biomass recalcitrance which influence its enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymatic saccharification was improved by changes in Eucalyptus induced by steam explosion pre-treatment, such as substantial removal of hemicelluloses, increased cellulose accessibility, and disruption of cell wall architecture and exposure of fibres. Partial removal of lignin, increased S/G lignin subunit ratio and lowered cellulose crystallinity exhibited no significant positive effects on biomass enzymatic hydrolyzability. Thus, this study provides insight into important chemical and structural features related to biomass recalcitrance arising from various pre-treatment methods, which can ultimately be used as a platform for the development of more efficient conversion technologies for novel and competitive bio-refineries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Three species of freshwater planktonic green microalgae: Ankistrodesmus braunii, Ankistrodesmus falcatus, and Scenedesmus incrassatulus, were isolated from the Nile water in Upper Egypt. These microalgae were exposed to nutritional (nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron) limitations and salinity stress to study their effects on the algal growth and to elevate the lipid content within their cells. The results indicated that exposure to these conditions had a significant impact on the algal growth. The lipid content of the studied algae increased as a result of the salinity stress. The highest lipid content was recorded in A. braunii culture treated with 50 mM NaCl (34.4% of dry weight) and S. incrassatulus cultures treated with 100 mM NaCl (37.7% of dry weight) on the 6th day of cultivation, while the culture of A. falcatus treated with 100 mM NaCl recorded the maximum lipid content (53% of dry weight) on the 10th day of the experiment. The biodiesel quality parameters of the fatty acid methyl ester profile of S. incrassatulus appeared to be in agreement with the international criteria. S. incrassatulus could be regarded as a quite promising feedstock for the biodiesel production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Although microalgae are seen as a potential alternative source of energy and other materials currently sourced from petroleum, issues still remain with industrialization because of difficulties in developing commercially operational microalgal production systems. We set up a pilot-scale study that involved the simultaneous reuse of wastewater and production of algae under different light and harvesting conditions. We cultivated Hydrodictyon reticulatum (H. reticulatum), a type of water-net algae, using secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant in a raceway open pond combined with an underwater light device. Experimental results showed that the underwater light device maintained some level of underwater light throughout the year. Photoinhibition of algal growth only occurred when the sunlight exceeded 1270 μmol m−2 s−1. During the non-harvest process, the maximum algal concentration was 1700 mg L−1 at 20 days after the experiment began, the maximum specific growth rate was 0.18 d−1 and the maximum productivity was 21.3 g m−2 d−1. Conversely, periodic harvesting decreased the concentration of nutrients in the effluent more as the days of cultivation increased, but the productivity of algae also decreased to 11.7 g m−2 d−1. The maximum yield of bioethanol using three kinds of fermentation strains was 93.5% and, thus, the commercial value of H. reticulatum as a raw material for energy production was excellent. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High-performance autotolerant bioelectrodes should be ideally suited to design implantable bioelectronic devices. Because of its high redox potential and ability to reduce oxygen directly to water, human ceruloplasmin, HCp, the only blue multicopper oxidase present in human plasma, appears to be the ultimate biocatalyst for oxygen biosensors and also biocathodes in biological power sources. In comparison to fungal and plant blue multicopper oxidases, e.g. Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase and Rhus vernicifera laccase, respectively, the inflammatory response to HCp in human blood is significantly reduced. Partial purification of HCp allowed to preserve the native conformation of the enzyme and its biocatalytic activity. Therefore, electrochemical studies were carried out with the partially purified enzyme immobilised on nanostructured graphite electrodes at physiological pH and temperature. Amperometric investigations revealed low reductive current densities, i.e. about 1.65 µA cm−2 in oxygenated electrolyte and in the absence of any mediator, demonstrating nevertheless direct electron transfer based O2 bioelectroreduction by HCp for the first time. The reductive current density obtained in the mediated system was about 12 µA cm−2. Even though the inflammatory response of HCp is diminished in human blood, inadequate bioelectrocatalytic performance hinders its use as a cathodic bioelement in a biofuel cell. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Improving plant biomass yield and/or feedstock quality for highly efficient lignocellulose conversion has been the main research focus in genetic modification of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a dedicated model plant for biofuel production. Here, we proved that overexpression of miR396 (OE-miR396) leads to reduced plant height and lignin content mainly by reducing G-lignin monomer content. We identified nineteen PvGRFs in switchgrass and proved thirteen of them were cleaved by miR396. MiR396-targeted PvGRF1, PvGRF9 and PvGRF3 showed significantly higher expression in stem. By separately overexpressing rPvGRF1, 3 and 9, in which synonymous mutations abolished the miR396 target sites, and suppression of PvGRF1/3/9 activity via PvGRF1/3/9-SRDX overexpression in switchgrass, we confirmed PvGRF1 and PvGRF9 played positive roles in improving plant height and G-lignin content. Overexpression of PvGRF9 was sufficient to complement the defective phenotype of OE-miR396 plants. MiR396-PvGRF9 modulates these traits partly by interfering GA and auxin biosynthesis and signalling transduction and cell wall lignin, glucose and xylan biosynthesis pathways. Moreover, by enzymatic hydrolysis analyses, we found that overexpression of rPvGRF9 significantly enhanced per plant sugar yield. Our results suggest that PvGRF9 can be utilized as a candidate molecular tool in modifying plant biomass yield and feedstock quality. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract: Microbial lipase from Burkholderia cepacia was immobilized by covalent bond and physical adsorption on SBA-15 mesoporous support and its catalytic efficiency was measured in the formation of fatty acids ethyl esters from palm kernel oil. The immobilized biocatalyst and its support were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, N2 Adsorption–desorption, and thermal analysis TG/DTG. The immobilization of the enzyme onto the support maintained the typical structure of the SBA-15. From the TG measurements, it can be deduced that about 25% of lipase was immobilized in SBA-15 via covalent bond and 15% was incorporated via physical adsorption. Both immobilized lipase preparations were used to perform the transesterification reactions using different oil: ethanol molar ratios and time. The biocatalyst prepared by physical adsorption promoted better results, measured by the apparent yield (&gt; 90%) and conversion (98.9%) in all reactions, which were also confirmed by viscosity and density data. The regeneration of SBA-15 support was found to be feasible and demonstrated efficiency for 5 times, reducing the associated costs of the process.

AB  - Abstract: Microalgae consists a promising feedstock for biofuel production due to their high growth rates and lipid content. Microalgal wastewater remediation can achieve both organic matters removal and biodiesel production, leading to economic benefits. In this study, immobilized microalgae and algae-bacteria consortia were used to treat synthetic fracturing wastewater. Organic matter removal, biomass production and lipid synthesis by co-culture of Chlorella vulgaris and Bacillus bacteria were investigated in comparison with an algae immobilization system during the process. The chemical oxygen demand removal rate and lipid concentration of the co-culture were both lower than those of the immobilized C. vulgaris, while algal biomass under the two cultivation conditions was similar. The immobilized algae provided higher amount of fatty acids, especially mono-unsaturated fatty acids, than the algae-bacteria consortia. Most of the fuel properties of biodiesel produced in both immobilized and co-cultured C. vulgaris complied with the specifications for standard biodiesel. The comparative results of enzyme activity showed that immobilization can enhance the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the key enzyme for fatty acids synthesis, leading to the formation of more fatty acids and lipids. Furthermore, immobilization decreased the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity and inhibited starch formation. Immobilization favors lipid production and removal of organics by C. vulgaris.

AB  - Although engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermenting cellobiose is useful for the production of biofuels from cellulosic biomass, cellodextrin accumulation is one of the main problems reducing ethanol yield and productivity in cellobiose fermentation with S. cerevisiae expressing cellodextrin transporter (CDT) and intracellular β-glucosidase (GH1-1). In this study, we investigated the reason for the cellodextrin accumulation and how to alleviate its formation during cellobiose fermentation using engineered S. cerevisiae fermenting cellobiose. From the series of cellobiose fermentation using S. cerevisiae expressing only GH1-1 under several culture conditions, it was discovered that small amounts of GH1-1 were secreted and cellodextrin was generated through trans-glycosylation activity of the secreted GH1-1. As GH1-1 does not have a secretion signal peptide, non-conventional protein secretion might facilitate the secretion of GH1-1. In cellobiose fermentations with S. cerevisiae expressing only GH1-1, knockout of TLG2 gene involved in non-conventional protein secretion pathway significantly delayed cellodextrin formation by reducing the secretion of GH1-1 by more than 50%. However, in cellobiose fermentations with S. cerevisiae expressing both GH1-1 and CDT-1, TLG2 knockout did not show a significant effect on cellodextrin formation, although secretion of GH1-1 was reduced by more than 40%. These results suggest that the development of new intracellular β-glucosidase, not influenced by non-conventional protein secretion, is required for better cellobiose fermentation performances of engineered S. cerevisiae fermenting cellobiose. © 2021 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology

AB  - Prior engineering of the ethanologen Zymomonas mobilis has enabled it to metabolize xylose and to produce 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) as a dominant fermentation product. When co-fermenting with xylose, glucose is preferentially utilized, even though xylose metabolism generates ATP more efficiently during 2,3-BDO production on a BDO-mol basis. To gain a deeper understanding of Z. mobilis metabolism, we first estimated the kinetic parameters of the glucose facilitator protein of Z. mobilis by fitting a kinetic uptake model, which shows that the maximum transport capacity of glucose is seven times higher than that of xylose, and glucose is six times more affinitive to the transporter than xylose. With these estimated kinetic parameters, we further compared the thermodynamic driving force and enzyme protein cost of glucose and xylose metabolism. It is found that, although 20% more ATP can be yielded stoichiometrically during xylose utilization, glucose metabolism is thermodynamically more favorable with 6% greater cumulative Gibbs free energy change, more economical with 37% less enzyme cost required at the initial stage and sustains the advantage of the thermodynamic driving force and protein cost through the fermentation process until glucose is exhausted. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and phosphoglycerate mutase (pgm) are identified as thermodynamic bottlenecks in glucose utilization pathway, as well as two more enzymes of xylose isomerase and ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase in xylose metabolism. Acetolactate synthase is found as potential engineering target for optimized protein cost supporting unit metabolic flux. Pathway analysis was then extended to the core stoichiometric matrix of Z. mobilis metabolism. Growth was simulated by dynamic flux balance analysis and the model was validated showing good agreement with experimental data. Dynamic FBA simulations suggest that a high agitation is preferable to increase 2,3-BDO productivity while a moderate agitation will benefit the 2,3-BDO titer. Taken together, this work provides thermodynamic and kinetic insights of Z. mobilis metabolism on dual substrates, and guidance of bioengineering efforts to increase hydrocarbon fuel production. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Spiller, Dowe, Bomble and St. John.

AB  - Disc refining is a critical step in the deacetylation and mechanical refining (DMR) pretreatment process for the conversion of herbaceous biomass to biofuels. It is very effective in breaking down the biomass structures to increase enzyme accessibility and sugar yield. However, it is also an energy-intensive process, which consumes fossil electricity, generating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and limits its commercialization in the biorefinery industry. To the authors’ best knowledge, this work is the first to report the development of a physics-based model in predicting the refining energy consumption during the biomass disc refining process. The developed model demonstrated its capability in accurately predicting the refining energy consumption under different operation conditions. Simulations show that the net refining energy consumption, net refining energy efficiency, and specific net energy increase with the increase in rotation speed and the decrease in the refiner plate gap. A convergence trend of these attributes was also observed between larger and smaller refiner plate gaps at increasing rotation speeds. In the scaling-up of the DMR pretreatment process, this model will be a powerful tool in the refiner plate design and operation parameter optimization to reach optimum refining energy consumption to reduce biofuel production cost and GHG emissions. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Transition to a new energy low carbon pool requires the gradual replacing of fossil fuels with other cleaner energies and biofuels. In this work, the environmental impact of renewable diesel production using an attributional life cycle assessment was evaluated by considering five stages: palm plantation-culture-harvest, palm oil extraction, palm oil refining, green (renewable) diesel production, and biofuel use. The functional unit was established as 1.6 × 10−2 m3 (13.13 kg) of renewable diesel. The results show that the production of renewable diesel by Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids is more environmentally friendly than fossil diesel production. In particular, the analysis showed that the CO2 emission decreases around 110% (i.e. mitigation occurred) compared with conventional diesel production. However, renewable diesel production has a relevant environmental impact in the human toxicity category due to the high consumption of agrochemicals during palm culture. © Copyright © 2021 Arguelles-Arguelles, Amezcua-Allieri and Ramírez-Verduzco.

AB  - Combination of butanol-hyperproducing and hypertolerant phenotypes is essential for developing microbial strains suitable for industrial production of bio-butanol, one of the most promising liquid biofuels. Clostridium cellulovorans is among the microbial strains with the highest potential for direct production of n-butanol from lignocellulosic wastes, a process that would significantly reduce the cost of bio-butanol. However, butanol exhibits higher toxicity compared to ethanol and C. cellulovorans tolerance to this solvent is low. In the present investigation, comparative gel-free proteomics was used to study the response of C. cellulovorans to butanol challenge and understand the tolerance mechanisms activated in this condition. Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical fragment ion spectra Mass Spectrometry (SWATH-MS) analysis allowed identification and quantification of differentially expressed soluble proteins. The study data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD024183. The most important response concerned modulation of protein biosynthesis, folding and degradation. Coherent with previous studies on other bacteria, several heat shock proteins (HSPs), involved in protein quality control, were up-regulated such as the chaperones GroES (Cpn10), Hsp90, and DnaJ. Globally, our data indicate that protein biosynthesis is reduced, likely not to overload HSPs. Several additional metabolic adaptations were triggered by butanol exposure such as the up-regulation of V- and F-type ATPases (involved in ATP synthesis/generation of proton motive force), enzymes involved in amino acid (e.g., arginine, lysine, methionine, and branched chain amino acids) biosynthesis and proteins involved in cell envelope re-arrangement (e.g., the products of Clocel_4136, Clocel_4137, Clocel_4144, Clocel_4162 and Clocel_4352, involved in the biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids) and a redistribution of carbon flux through fermentative pathways (acetate and formate yields were increased and decreased, respectively). Based on these experimental findings, several potential gene targets for metabolic engineering strategies aimed at improving butanol tolerance in C. cellulovorans are suggested. This includes overexpression of HSPs (e.g., GroES, Hsp90, DnaJ, ClpC), RNA chaperone Hfq, V- and F-type ATPases and a number of genes whose function in C. cellulovorans is currently unknown. © Copyright © 2021 Costa, Usai, Re, Manfredi, Mannino, Bertea, Pessione and Mazzoli.

AB  - The food wastage problem and its associated issues have become a significant threat to sustainable development, particularly in developing countries. Cooked rice, which has been reported to be one of the most abundant regional food wastes, is a substantial feedstock for biofuel production due to its rich carbon content. In this study, both solid-state and acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentations were conducted in series with Aspergillus oryzae and aero-tolerant Clostridium acetobutylicum YM1 for the biobutanol production. To validate the process parameters for an industrial-scale process, it is critical to examine the effects of process parameters using a process simulation tool. To this end, by adapting lab-scale process results, a techno-economic evaluation of the biobutanol production from the cooked rice by two-step fermentation was performed using SuperPro Designer®. This study aims to examine various scenarios for cooked rice utilization to produce butanol while examining process optimization and minimization of operational expenses for the aerobic ABE fermentation and microbial saccharification. According to the simulation results, butanol production cost was estimated to be 1.24 $ kg-1, incorporating a cost reduction of 0.58 $ kg-1 from heat integration, steam and power generation, while eliminating costs for the unnecessary commercial enzymes and N2 gas for purging. Finally, sensitivity analysis was applied to demonstrate the plant feasibility concerning potential fluctuations in the changing biofuel market and environmental conditions. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii serves as a model organism for plant and photosynthesis research due to many commonalities in metabolism and to the fast growth rate of C. reinhardtii which accelerates experimental turnaround time. In addition, C. reinhardtii is a focus of research efforts in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology for the potential production of biofuels and value-added chemicals. Here, we report that the C. reinhardtii cia5 mutant, which lacks a functional carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM), can produce substantial amounts of glycolate, a high-value cosmetic ingredient, when the mutant is cultured under ambient air conditions. In order to reveal the metabolic basis of glycolate accumulation by the cia5 mutant, we investigated the metabolomes of the cia5 mutant and a wild type strain CC-125 (WT) through the global metabolic profiling of intracellular and extracellular fractions using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We observed the intracellular and extracellular metabolic profiles of the WT and the cia5 mutant were similar during the mixotrophic phase at 30 h. However, when the cells entered the photoautotrophic phase (i.e., 96 h and 120 h), both the intracellular and extracellular metabolic profiles of cia5 mutant differed significantly when compared to WT. In the cia5 mutant strain, a group of photorespiration pathway intermediates including glycolate, glyoxylate, glycine, and serine accumulated to significantly higher levels compared to WT. In the photorespiration pathway, glycolate is metabolized to glyoxylate and glycine leading to NH3 and CO2 generation during the mitochondrial conversion of glycine to serine. This result provides further evidence that the CIA5 mutation increased the photorespiration rate. Because the cia5 mutant lacks a CCM, and C. reinhardtii might harbor an inefficient or incomplete photorespiration pathway, glycolate may accumulate when the CCM is not functional. We envision that investigating photorespiration controls in C. reinhardtii provides tools for producers to use the cia5 mutant to produce glycolate as well as platform to engineer alternative pathways for glycolate metabolism. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) under psychrophilic temperature has only recently garnered deserved attention. In major parts of Europe, USA, Canada and Australia, climatic conditions are more suited for psychrophilic (<20 ℃) rather than mesophilic (35 – 37 ℃) and thermophilic (55 – 60 ℃) AD. Low temperature has adverse effects on important cellular processes which may render the cell biology inactive. Moreover, cold climate can also alter the physical and chemical properties of wastewater, thereby reducing the availability of substrate to microbes. Hence, the use of low temperature acclimated microbial biomass could overcome thermodynamic constraints and carry out flexible structural and conformational changes to proteins, membrane lipid composition, expression of cold-adapted enzymes through genotypic and phenotypic variations. Reduction in organic loading rate is beneficial to methane production under low temperatures. Moreover, modification in the design of existing reactors and the use of hybrid reactors have already demonstrated improved methane generation in the lab-scale. This review also discusses some novel strategies such as direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), co-digestion of substrate, bioaugmentation, and bioelectrochemical system assisted AD which present promising prospects. While DIET can facilitate syntrophic electron exchange in diverse microbes, the addition of organic-rich co-substrate can help in maintaining suitable C/N ratio in the anaerobic digester which subsequently can enhance methane generation. Bioaugmentation with psychrophilic strains could reduce start-up time and ensure daily stable performance for wastewater treatment facilities at low temperatures. In addition to the technical discussion, the economic assessment and future outlook on psychrophilic AD are also highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Deep eutectic solvents (DES), a new class of alternative solvents, have recently been used in the pre-treatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Due to the ability to dissolve phenolic compounds, they have been efficiently applied as delignification agents. However, to extend DES application to bioprocesses, such as Anaerobic Digestion (AD), their toxicity to microbial consortia must be evaluated. In this work, an effective delignifying DES, composed of choline chloride (ChCl) and oxalic acid (OA) (1:1) was prepared and its effect evaluated, for the first time, in biogas production. Results show that the presence of DES had both beneficial and detrimental effects on the anaerobic consortium, depending on its concentration. In the concentration range of 0.3–12.5 g/L, the presence of DES led to a lag-phase of 1 to 8 d as the DES concentration increased. However, after the lag-phase has been surpassed, DES up to a concentration of 12.5 g/L improved the biogas production, reaching an accumulated biogas volume three times higher than the control assay for the concentration of 12.5 g/L. For the highest DES concentrations (19.8–78.1 g/L), the biogas production was inhibited. The assays performed with DES components alone have indicated that OA at 3.2 g/L was the main responsible for the inhibition of biogas production (50% less biogas produced than the control). ChCl at 4.9 g/L has not presented a lag-phase and produced an accumulated biogas volume like the control assay (1200 mL for 30 d incubation). This work points out that ChCl:OA DES may be used in the delignification of biomass further submitted to AD, provided the inhibitory concentrations of OA are not achieved. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study was aimed to isolate fast-growing thraustochytrids and the influence of seasonal variation in fatty acid composition from the mangrove habitat. The thraustochytrids were isolated from fallen yellowish or green mangrove leaves, in four seasons, including winter, summer, rainy, and post rainy season in one year. The thraustochytrids were analyzed for biomass production, total lipid content, and fatty acid profile. The thraustochytrid isolates showed biomass yield and total lipid content in the range of 14.12 ± 0.69 to 22.98 ± 0.53 g/L and 34.98–58.86% per dry cell weight, respectively. The isolates showed two dominant fatty acids, palmitic acid (PA) as saturated fatty acid (SFA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in total fatty acid (TFA) content. The significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed for seasonal variations in SFA and DHA content in summer isolates and winter isolates. The maximum DHA content with 47.12% of TFA, recorded in winter (January) isolates and summer (April) isolates with SFA 68.82% of TFA. The results from this study were verified the hypothesis that the presence of high DHA producing thraustochytrids in lower temperature season in the same habitat. These findings have also emphasized the role of the environmental temperature conditions and the importance of thraustochytrid fatty acid composition as a dietary biomarker. Also, it revealed the ecological significance of thraustochytrid in DHA enrichment in the food web of the marine ecosystem. These findings could be useful while isolating thraustochytrids according to seasons for industrial application for omega 3 fatty acids and biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To achieve a high-rate operation of co-digestion with waste activated sludge (WAS) and food waste (FW) for biogas production, a low-magnitude loading regime was investigated in a mesophilic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) over long-term operation for approximately 600 days. The results showed that high-rate mesophilic CSTR co-digestion was realized using the low-magnitude loading regime. A maximum methane production of 12.9 L/L/day was achieved in the mesophilic CSTR co-digestion at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 48.1 g-COD/L/day. Moreover, high-efficiency and stable mesophilic CSTR co-digestion can still be performed at OLR of 50.8–52.1 g-COD/L/day and solid retention time (SRT) of 2.56–2.63 days without volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation. A high methane yield, hydrolysis conversion ratio, and methanogenic activity and the key anaerobic digestion enzymes were all maintained during the high-rate operation period. 16S rRNA gene sequencing results indicated that the relative abundance of the class Clostridia and genus Methanosarcina could reach 85.0% and 97.3%, respectively, corresponding to a high hydrolysis rate and VFA conversion rate. The metabolic capability of the genus Methanosarcina was the main reason for the highly efficient and stable operation of the mesophilic CSTR co-digestion. Using metagenomic analysis, Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanosarcina flavescens were established as the main methane-producing species during high-rate mesophilic CSTR co-digestion. The enrichment of the genus Methanosarcina through a low-magnitude loading regime is a promising method for realizing the highly efficient and stable operation of co-digestion with WAS and FW for biogas production at low retention times. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol has attracted much attention as it is of great benefit to social and environmental sustainability. However, the adverse properties of lignocellulosic biomass (i.e.low bulk density, fluffy/difficult to handle, and being easily contaminated by microbes), and issues related to biomass pretreatment (i.e.high energy consumption, difficulty in scale-up and low fermentability of pretreated biomass), largely impede the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol. To address these issues, we invented a novel pretreatment method, Densifying Lignocellulosic biomass with alkaline Chemicals (DLC), and studied DLC on corn stover (CS). DLC-CS has high density and high durability, with contamination prevented and sugar fully preserved, which greatly facilitates biomass logistics. DLC-CS showed high enzymatic digestibility and high fermentability after storage. DLC-CS containing calcium hydroxide yielded 21.4 g of ethanol per 100 g of CS, which was further enhanced to 25.3 g of ethanol per 100 g of CS using a regular steam autoclave. An ethanol titer as high as 70.6 g L−1was achieved, for the first time, without washing or detoxification of the pretreated biomass. These promising results demonstrated the great potential of DLC pretreatment for lignocellulosic biofuel production. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - The banana is an important fruit crop that generates enormous quantities of lignocellulose-rich pseudostem residues that can be converted into biofuels and biochemicals. By performing response surface methodological modeling, optimized green liquor (GL) and liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatments of representative banana samples were studied. Using banana (BP-1) pseudostem residues rich in directly fermentable soluble sugars (27% hexoses and 2.7% pentosesviadry matter) and easily digestible xyloglucans, we measured nearly complete enzymatic saccharification with a hexose yield of 99% (% cellulose) from the most optimal GL pretreatment under relatively mild conditions. Notably, both optimal LHW (20 min, 110 °C) and GL (26.74% TTA, 105 °C, 26 min) pretreatments led to the highest bioethanol yields achieved thus far, at 27% and 31% (% dry matter), respectively, subjective to yeast fermentation with all hexose sources obtained in the BP-1 sample. Furthermore, we determined that optimal LHW and GL pretreatments extracted lignin by 25% and 40%, and reduced the cellulose crystalline index by 35% and 44% and polymerization degree by 34% and 36%, respectively, with distinctively altered lignin and hemicellulose features. Cellulose accessibility was increased 2-3 fold for remarkably enhanced enzymatic saccharification of biomass. Hence, we propose a mechanism model to elucidate why banana lignocellulose underwent complete biomass enzymatic saccharification under mild green-like pretreatments, providing an applicable strategy that can be used to produce large quantities of bioethanol from banana lignocellulose residues and beyond. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Xylan and cellulose are the two major constituents of numerous types of lignocellulose. The bifunctional enzyme that exhibits xylanase/cellulase activity has attracted a great deal of attention in biofuel production. Previously, a thermostable GH10 family enzyme (XynA) from Bacillus sp. KW1 was found to degrade both xylan and cellulose. To improve bifunctional activity on the basis of structure, we first determined the crystal structure of XynA at 2.3 Å. Via molecular docking and activity assays, we revealed that Gln250 and His252 were indispensable to bifunctionality, because they could interact with two conserved catalytic residues, Glu182 and Glu280, while bringing the substrate close to the activity pocket. Then we used a structure-based engineering strategy to improve xylanase/cellulase activity. Although no mutants with increased bifunctional activity were obtained after much screening, we found the answer in the N-terminal 36-amino acid truncation of XynA. The activities of XynA_ΔN36 toward beechwood xylan, wheat arabinoxylan, filter paper, and barley β-glucan were significantly increased by 0.47-, 0.53-, 2.46-, and 1.04-fold, respectively. Furthermore, upon application, this truncation released more reducing sugars than the wild type in the degradation of pretreated corn stover and sugar cane bagasse. These results showed the detailed molecular mechanism of the GH10 family bifunctional endoxylanase/cellulase. The basis of these catalytic performances and the screened XynA_ΔN36 provide clues for the further use of XynA in industrial applications. ©

AB  - Understanding the influence of method choices on results in life-cycle assessments is essential to draw informed conclusions. As the climate impact of bioenergy remains a debated topic, the focus of this study is how the chosen temporal framing influences a comparison of the climate impact of utilizing residual biomass for biofuel production to that of leaving the biomass to decay. In order to compare the biofuel scenario to its corresponding reference scenario where biomass is left to decay, a variety of analytical approaches were used: using time-aggregated and time-dependent life-cycle inventories and climate-impact assessment methods, assuming biogenic carbon to be climate neutral or not, using metrics for cumulative or instantaneous climate impact, and with different time horizons. Two cases of residual biofuel feedstocks were assessed: logging residues from Norway spruce forest, and straw from wheat cultivation. Consideration of the studied method choices appears to be especially relevant for forest residual biomass, as illustrated by the ranges of parity times for logging residues (25 to 95 years), and the results which vary with the chosen climate-impact metric, time-horizon, and approach for including biogenic carbon. Illustrating the time-dependence of results can, in general, provide a better understanding of the climate impact of utilizing residual biomass for biofuels. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - The release of glucose from lignocellulosic waste for subsequent fermentation into biofuels holds promise for securing humankind's future energy needs. The discovery of a set of copper-dependent enzymes known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) has galvanised new research in this area. LPMOs act by oxidatively introducing chain breaks into cellulose and other polysaccharides, boosting the ability of cellulases to act on the substrate. Although several proteins have been implicated as electron sources in fungal LPMO biochemistry, no equivalent bacterial LPMO electron donors have been previously identified, although the proteins Cbp2D and E from Cellvibrio japonicus have been implicated as potential candidates. Here we analyse a small c-type cytochrome (CjX183) present in Cellvibrio japonicus Cbp2D, and show that it can initiate bacterial CuII/I LPMO reduction and also activate LPMO-catalyzed cellulose-degradation. In the absence of cellulose, CjX183-driven reduction of the LPMO results in less H2O2 production from O2, and correspondingly less oxidative damage to the enzyme than when ascorbate is used as the reducing agent. Significantly, using CjX183 as the activator maintained similar cellulase boosting levels relative to the use of an equivalent amount of ascorbate. Our results therefore add further evidence to the impact that the choice of electron source can have on LPMO action. Furthermore, the study of Cbp2D and other similar proteins may yet reveal new insight into the redox processes governing polysaccharide degradation in bacteria. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Redox catalysts, including hydrogenases, can be embedded into films made of redox polymers, whose side chains mediate electrons between the catalyst and an electrode. These films can be used as bioanodes in H2-based biofuel cells, because they protect the catalyst from O2-induced inactivation: self-protection occurs because a fraction of the incoming H2 is used in the outer region of the film to catalytically produce electrons that reduce the O2 molecules that penetrate the film. Here, we focus on the case of unidirectional catalysis (e. g. H2 oxidation) by an enzyme that is irreversibly inactivated by O2, embedded in a film of arbitrary thickness. We analytically solve the reaction/diffusion system to fully describe the time evolution of the penetration of O2 and we discuss the amount of H2 consumed by the protection mechanism. We establish the relations between film thickness, electron conduction, catalyst use and life time. This provides the theoretical framework required to optimize the design of these systems. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - In recent years, biofuels have been receiving significant attention because of their potential for decreasing carbon emissions and providing a long-term renewable solution to unsustainable fossil fuels. Currently, lactones are some of the alternatives being produced. Many lactones occur in a range of natural substances and have many advantages over bioethanol. In this study, the oxidation of alpha-angelica lactone initiated by ground-state atomic oxygen, O(3P), was studied at 298, 550, and 700 K using synchrotron radiation coupled with multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). Photoionization spectra and kinetic time traces were measured to identify the primary products. Ketene, acetaldehyde, methyl vinyl ketone, methylglyoxal, dimethyl glyoxal, and 5-methyl-2,4-furandione were characterized as major reaction products, with ketene being the most abundant at all three temperatures. Possible reaction pathways for the formation of the observed primary products were computed using the CBS–QB3 composite method. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Banana is a major fruit crop throughout the world with abundant lignocellulose in the pseudostem and rachis residues for biofuel production. In this study, we collected a total of 11 pseudostems and rachis samples that were originally derived from different genetic types and ecological locations of banana crops and then examined largely varied edible carbohydrates (soluble sugars, starch) and lignocellulose compositions. By performing chemical (H2SO4, NaOH) and liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatments, we also found a remarkable variation in biomass enzymatic saccharification and bioethanol production among all banana samples examined. Consequently, this study identified a desirable banana (Refen1, subgroup Pisang Awak) crop containing large amounts of edible carbohydrates and completely digestible lignocellulose, which could be combined to achieve the highest bioethanol yields of 31–38% (% dry matter), compared with previously reported ones in other bioenergy crops. Chemical analysis further indicated that the cellulose CrI and lignin G-monomer should be two major recalcitrant factors affecting biomass enzymatic saccharification in banana pseudostems and rachis. Therefore, this study not only examined rich edible carbohydrates for food in the banana pseudostems but also detected digestible lignocellulose for bioethanol production in rachis tissue, providing a strategy applicable for genetic breeding and biomass processing in banana crops. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - There are two types of cytochrome P450 enzymes in nature, namely, the monooxygenases and the peroxygenases. Both enzyme classes participate in substrate biodegradation or biosynthesis reactions in nature, but the P450 monooxygenases use dioxygen, while the peroxygenases take H2O2 in their catalytic cycle instead. By contrast to the P450 monooxygenases, the P450 peroxygenases do not require an external redox partner to deliver electrons during the catalytic cycle, and also no external proton source is needed. Therefore, they are fully self‐sufficient, which affords them opportunities in biotechnological applications. One specific P450 peroxygenase, namely, P450 OleTJE, reacts with long‐chain linear fatty acids through oxidative decarboxylation to form hydrocarbons and, as such, has been implicated as a suitable source for the biosynthesis of biofuels. Unfortunately, the reactions were shown to produce a considerable amount of side products originating from Cα and Cβ hydroxylation and desaturation. These product distributions were found to be strongly dependent on whether the substrate had substituents on the Cα and/or Cβ atoms. To understand the bifurcation pathways of substrate activation by P450 OleTJE leading to decarboxylation, Cα hydroxylation, Cβ hydroxylation and Cα-Cβ desaturation, we performed a computational study using 3‐phenylpropionate and 2‐phenylbutyrate as substrates. We set up large cluster models containing the heme, the substrate and the key features of the substrate binding pocket and calculated (using density functional theory) the pathways leading to the four possible products. This work predicts that the two substrates will react with different reaction rates due to accessibility differences of the substrates to the active oxidant, and, as a consequence, these two substrates will also generate different products. This work explains how the substrate binding pocket of P450 OleTJE guides a reaction to a chemoselectivity. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Although cancer is traditionally considered a genetic disease, the epigenetic abnormal-ities, including DNA hypermethylation, histone deacetylation, and/or microRNA dysregulation, have been demonstrated as a hallmark of cancer. Compared with gene mutations, aberrant epigenetic changes occur more frequently, and cellular epigenome is more susceptible to change by environmental factors. Excess cancer risks are positively associated with exposure to occupational and environmental chemical carcinogens, including those from gasoline combustion exhausted in vehicles. Of note, previous studies proposed particulate matter index (PMI) as a measure for gasoline sooting tendency, and showed that, compared with the other molecules in gasoline, 1,2,4– Trimethylbenzene, 2–methylnaphthalene and toluene significantly contribute to PMI of the gasoline blends. Mechanistically, both epigenome and genome are important in carcinogenicity, and the genotoxicity of chemical agents has been thoroughly studied. However, less effort has been put into studying the epigenotoxicity. Moreover, as the blending of ethanol into gasoline substitutes for carcinogens, like benzene, toluene, xylene, butadiene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, etc., a reduction of secondary aromatics has been achieved in the atmosphere. This may lead to diminished cancer initiation and progression through altered cellular epigenetic landscape. The present review summarizes the most important findings in the literature on the association between exposures to carcinogens from gasoline combustion, cancer epigenetics and the potential epigenetic impacts of biofuels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Nematodes as plant pathogens adversely affect food, fiber, and biofuels production by causing plant diseases. A variety of chemical nematicides are being applied to soil, seeds, or foliage with a goal of disease prevention. Despite the proven efficacy of these chemicals against plant-parasitic nematodes, factors like prolonged residual toxicity to human health, environmental pollution, and the risk of resistance development can't be neglected. Due to these reasons, many chemicals are being banned continuously or delimited in the crop production system. Alternatively, the need for long-term strategies and integrative approaches to control plant diseases is inevitable. Trichoderma spp. are widely used in agriculture as biological control agents (BCA). To our knowledge, either very little or no information available on the most recent developments regarding Trichoderma-mediated biological control of plant-parasitic nematodes. This review summarizes the recent advances in using Trichoderma as BCA and plant growth regulator with a special focus on plant-parasitic nematodes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Biorefining of Chinese food waste (FW) into transport fuels was assessed in terms of amount of fuel produced and over all Global Warming Potential (GWP) for six different scenarios including biogas, biomethane, bioethanol and biodiesel in different combinations. The life-cycle perspective used included GWP aspects of material and energy use, emissions during biorefining and management of residues, as well as substitution of fossil fuels according to the energy content of biofuels. All of the six FW biorefineries revealed savings in GWP ranging from −19 to −138 kg CO2 eqv. per ton of wet FW. Compared to the reference scenario with only anaerobic digestion (S0), introducing biogas upgrading to biomethane (S1) improved the GWP by 37%; while producing bioethanol prior to anaerobic digestion (S2) decreased the savings in GWP. Introducing biodiesel prior to anaerobic digestion (S3) revealed around 60% improvement in GWP, while combining biodiesel and biomethane gave the largest improvement in GWP, 84% compared to the reference scenario, and the most fuels (around 2400 MJ in terms of 30 kg biodiesel and 35 kg biomethane per ton of wet FW). A sensitivity analysis revealed that the electricity production based on the biogas was an important parameter and appears in all refineries, while the results was less sensitive to the production of biodiesel and biomethane. The residue management contributed also to the GWP, but did not vary much among the biorefinery scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of rice straw (RS) was enhanced to produce biobutanol as biofuel, for which the NaOH pretreatment was optimized by considering the butanol-biomass ratio that quantify the mass balance efficiency of the three sequential stages of the process: pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation by Clostridium beijerinckii. The optimum point (solid loading of 5% w/v with 0.75% w/v NaOH at 134 °C for 20 min) of the best cost-wise option yielded an enhanced biomass use of 77.6 g kg RS−1. A maximum butanol titer of 10.1 g L−1 was reached after 72 h of fermentation with the complete uptake of glucose and nearly complete uptake of xylose. The NaOH concentration was the most influential parameter. The appropriate dosage to maximize fermentable sugars instead of the mass balance efficiency of the three stages underestimated the biomass use by 13%, showing the importance of correctly selecting the variable response during optimization. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The bioenergy crops such as energycane, miscanthus, and sorghum are being genetically modified using state of the art synthetic biotechnology techniques to accumulate energy-rich molecules such as triacylglycerides (TAGs) in their vegetative cells to enhance their utility for biofuel production. During the initial genetic developmental phase, many hundreds of transgenic phenotypes are produced. The efficiency of the production pipeline requires early and minimally destructive determination of oil content in individuals. Current screening methods require time-intensive sample preparation and extraction with chemical solvents for each plant tissue. A rapid screen will also be needed for developing industrial extraction as these crops become available. In the present study, we have devised a proton relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) method for single-step, non-invasive, and chemical-free characterization of in-situ lipids in untreated and pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. The systematic evaluation of NMR relaxation time distribution provided insight into the proton environment associated with the lipids in the biomass. It resolved two distinct lipid-associated subpopulations of proton nuclei that characterize total in-situ lipids into bound and free oil based on their “molecular tumbling” rate. The T1T2 correlation spectra also facilitated the resolution of the influence of various pretreatment procedures on the chemical composition of molecular and local 1H population in each sample. Furthermore, we show that hydrothermally pretreated biomass is suitable for direct NMR analysis unlike dilute acid and alkaline pretreated biomass which needs an additional step for neutralization. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The chain length (CL) of fatty acids (FAs) is pivotal to oil property, yet to what extent it can be customized in industrial oleaginous microalgae is unknown. In Nannochloropsis oceanica, to modulate long-chain FAs (LCFAs), we first discovered a fungi/bacteria-originated polyketide synthase (PKS) system which involves a cytoplasmic acyl-ACP thioesterase (NoTE1). NoTE1 hydrolyzes C16:0-, C16:1- and C18:1-ACP in vitro and thus intercepts the specific acyl-ACPs elongated by PKS for polyunsaturated FA biosynthesis, resulting in elevation of C16/C18 monounsaturated FAs when overproduced and increase of C20 when knocked out. For medium-chain FAs (MCFAs; C8-C14), C8:0 and C10:0 FAs are boosted by introducing a Cuphea palustris acyl-ACP TE (CpTE), whereas C12:0 elevated by rationally engineering CpTE enzyme's substrate-binding pocket to shift its CL preference towards C12:0. A mechanistic model exploiting both native and engineered PKS and type II FAS pathways was thus proposed for manipulation of carbon distribution among FAs of various CL. The ability to tailor FA profile at the unit CL resolution from C8 to C20 in Nannochloropsis spp. lays the foundation for scalable production of designer lipids via industrial oleaginous microalgae. © 2021 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - Robust and efficient enzymes are essential modules for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies across biological systems to engineer whole-cell biocatalysts. By condensing an acyl-CoA and an alcohol, alcohol acyltransferases (AATs) can serve as interchangeable metabolic modules for microbial biosynthesis of a diverse class of ester molecules with broad applications as flavors, fragrances, solvents, and drop-in biofuels. However, the current lack of robust and efficient AATs significantly limits their compatibility with heterologous precursor pathways and microbial hosts. Through bioprospecting and rational protein engineering, we identified and engineered promiscuity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CATs) from mesophilic prokaryotes to function as robust and efficient AATs compatible with at least 21 alcohol and 8 acyl-CoA substrates for microbial biosynthesis of linear, branched, saturated, unsaturated and/or aromatic esters. By plugging the best engineered CAT (CATec3 Y20F) into the gram-negative mesophilic bacterium Escherichia coli, we demonstrated that the recombinant strain could effectively convert various alcohols into desirable esters, for instance, achieving a titer of 13.9 g/L isoamyl acetate with 95% conversion by fed-batch fermentation. The recombinant E. coli was also capable of simulating the ester profile of roses with high conversion (>97%) and titer (>1 g/L) from fermentable sugars at 37 °C. Likewise, a recombinant gram-positive, cellulolytic, thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum harboring CATec3 Y20F could produce many of these esters from recalcitrant cellulosic biomass at elevated temperatures (>50 °C) due to the engineered enzyme's remarkable thermostability. Overall, the engineered CATs can serve as a robust and efficient platform for designer ester biosynthesis from renewable and sustainable feedstocks. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Sugarcane production for biorenewables demands substantial inputs of nitrogen (N) fertilizer that can lead to environmental consequences, and no clear effect has been reported on soil organic carbon (SOC) and N stocks. The use of a previous legume crops cultivation to add N to soil is a promising strategy to reduce the dependence in synthetic N fertilizer, having an international appeal for sustainable production of bioenergy crops. This study investigates a four-year impact of N fertilization on SOC and N stocks and sugarcane ratoon yields in a sandy and clayey soils, while considering the effects of a legume cover crop cultivated during the renovation period on decreasing N fertilizer requirements. Treatments with N fertilizer rates were arranged in a randomized block design after plant-cane harvest: 60, 120, 180 kg N ha−1 and control (without N) in two paired areas previously managed with Crotalaria spectabilis and bare fallow. Soil samples for SOC and N stocks were quantified at the beginning of the trial, and measured again along with microbiological attributes after four consecutive years, while sugarcane yield was assessed annually. SOC and N stocks were unaffected by N fertilizer rates, whereas the cultivation of cover crop increased soil N storage and microbial biomass carbon. There was limited responsiveness of sugarcane ratoons to additional N supplied by inorganic fertilizer under cover crop, whereas positive responses occurred under bare fallow. Considering the average of four-harvest yields, cover crop increased sugarcane yield by 9 % (5 Mg ha−1) at sandy soil and 15 % (16 Mg ha−1) at clayey soil relative to bare fallow. Cover crop provided an annual N fertilizer replacement of 9 and 15 kg ha−1 in the sandy and clayey soils. The long-lasting historical effect of cover crop in increasing sugarcane yield per area without the need for extra N from fertilizer opens a new possibility to increase the sustainability and alleviate associated greenhouse gas emissions of sugarcane fields by allowing savings in synthetic N fertilizer. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Long-term research on biofuel production from lignocellulose did not progress much due to strong inter-unit linkages in lignin structure. Lignin contains β-O-4 linkage as a major bond (50–60%) between aromatic compounds to form a complex 3D-structure. The present study aims for the characterization of a novel strain Burkholderia sp. ISTR5 (R5) for β-O-4 linkage disintegration. Guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacyl ether (GGE) was taken as a representative compound for β-O-4 linkage analysis. We showed that the strain R5 completely degraded GGE in 72 h. Further, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) profile showed that vanillin is one of the highest produced chemicals during the degradation of GGE with small fractions of other metabolites in the reaction mixture. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis demonstrated the fragmentation of β-O-4 bonds and the advent of new chemical bonds. In addition to it, the whole genome analysis showed that R5 contains a superior enzyme chassis for the degradation of aromatic compounds. Enzymes such as glutathione-s-transferase, biphenyl dioxygenase, catalase/peroxidase, hydrolases, and dehydrogenases dominated the genome of R5. Proteomics analysis showed 2 glutathione lyase, 1 glutathione-s-transferase, 1 GMC oxidoreductase, 2 FAD binding oxidoreductase and several hydrolases, peroxidases, and transferases were upregulated on GGE. This study showed the capability of R5 to degrade and bioconvert the β-O-4 linkage lignin model compound GGE into vanillin. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Physicochemical pretreatments used to improve the bioconversion of recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass generate toxic by-products, such as furan and phenols. In this study, 40 fungal strains were analyzed for their capability to grow with different concentrations of furfural, vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and syringaldehyde. Byssochlamys nivea MUT 6321 showed promising growth performance when the inhibitors were used as single molecules and it was the only fungus that could grow when the four molecules were simultaneously present in the culture media. Further trials demonstrated that B. nivea was able to completely degrade furfural in 24 h and the phenolic aldehydes, as single molecules, in less than 11 days. In the presence of the three phenolic aldehydes, the fungus was able to transform them. However, when furfural was present in the mix, faster and preferential consumption of furfural instead of phenolic aldehydes was observed. This study provides important information for the use of this fungus to remove toxic compounds present in pretreated lignocellulosic biomass that could potentially lead to the enhancement of the efficiency of biofuels and chemicals production. © 2021

AB  - Further increases in the current density of biofuel cells are partly limited by the deactivation of enzymes upon adsorption on hydrophobic carbon materials. A hyperthermophilic enzyme, hyperthermophilic laccase, was employed in the present study and the change in the activities and secondary structures upon adsorption on carbon black (CB) were evaluated by the oxidation rate of 2,2-Azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) and by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively, in comparison with the mesophilic enzymes, laccase from Trametes versicolor (denoted as mesophilic laccase), and glucose oxidase (GOx). Hyperthermophilic laccase retained its specific activities and secondary structures upon adsorption on CB compared with the other two enzymes mesophilic laccase and GOx. © 2021 JPhys Energy.

AB  - Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is the second most important oilseed crop in edible vegetable oil and bioenergy; however, drought stress generally causes a decrease in rapeseed yield and oil content, especially during the reproductive stage. In our study, we measured the oil and protein contents and gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) levels in seeds that were acquired on the 30th, 40th, and 50th days after flowering under control and drought treatments. RNA and protein libraries were constructed from the stressed seeds to perform transcriptome and proteome analyses, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the oil content decreased due to four primary mechanisms: downregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis-associated genes and proteins; upregulation of fatty acid degradation-associated genes and proteins; enhancement of protein storage due to changes in the abundances of relevant genes and proteins; and upregulation of Gly-Asp-Ser-Leu (GDSL) gene expression, potentially as the result of upregulating the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox3 and downregulating the GA inactivating gene GA2ox3 and thus an increase in GA content. During seed maturation, oil storage change may also relate to increasing ABA content as the upregulation of two members of NCED6 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase) gene family involved in ABA biosynthesis, and the upregulation of genes involved in ABA signal transduction. These results will help to establish a foundation for breeding excellent varieties of rapeseed with high oil content for areas with frequent droughts to promote the supply of edible vegetable oil and biofuel. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Laccases and laccase-mediator systems (LMS) are versatile catalysts that can oxidize a broad range of substrates coupled to the sole reduction of dioxygen to water. They possess many biotechnological applications in paper, textile, and food industries, bioethanol production, organic synthesis, detection and degradation of pollutants, and biofuel cell development. In particular, bacterial laccases are getting relevance due to their activity in a wide range of pH and temperature and their robustness under harsh conditions. However, the enzyme and the redox mediator's availability and costs limit their large-scale commercial use. Here we demonstrate that β-(10-phenothiazyl)-propionic acid can be used as an efficient and low-cost redox mediator for decolorizing synthetic dyes by the recombinant laccase SilA from Streptomyces ipomoeae produced in E. coli. This new LMS can decolorize more than 80% indigo carmine and malachite green in 1 h at pH = 8.0 and 2 h in tap water (pH = 6.8). Furthermore, it decolorized more than 40% of anthraquinone dye remazol brilliant blue R and 80% of azo dye xylidine ponceau in 5 h at 50 °C, pH 8.0. It supported at least 3 decolorization cycles without losing activity, representing an attractive candidate for a cost-effective and environmentally friendly LMS functional at neutral to alkaline pH. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells are a promising and environmentally friendly technology for energy generation from renewable fuel sources. Glucose biofuel cells employ enzymatic catalysts at both the anode and cathode to oxidize glucose and reduce oxygen while producing electricity. Consequently, there is a need for materials capable of immobilizing enzymes and facilitating efficient electron transfer between an electrode surface and an enzymatic active site. Here, we describe a chloroferrocene-modified linear poly(ethylenimine) capable of mediating electro-enzymatic oxygen reduction by laccase. Enzymatic biocathodes constructed using this mediator generated current densities up to 2.66 mA cm−2, and up to 636 μW cm−2 (Eoc = 0.6 V) power when combined with a tetramethylferrocene-mediated glucose oxidase bioanode to construct a biofuel cell mediated entirely by ferrocenes. © 2021

AB  - Fungus, Trichoderma longibrachiatum, was used for the pretreatment of broiler farm derived-lignocellulosic bedding material (rice husk) to enhance the subsequent solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD). Fungal pretreatment efficacy was evaluated through a series of batch studies with respect to carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio and pretreatment time. Lignocellulosic outer layer structure disruption of the rice husk was prominent under the best fungal pretreatment condition evaluated (C/N ratio of 18.9 and pretreatment time of 7 days). Consequently, the resulting methane yield of 438.1 ± 20.0 NmL/gVSadded was obtained which was ~2.0-folds higher than that of the control (without pretreatment). Furthermore, in semi-continuous SS-AD, fungal pretreatment could significantly enhance digestibility of organic substance in high solid loading (30% total solids) AD process by 3.2-folds and improve microbial kinetic parameters with subsequent daily methane yield improvement by 2.4-folds. Thus, fungal pretreatment could be an environmentally-friendly and effective low-cost approach for broiler farm-derived waste management to enhance SS-AD efficacy. © 2021

AB  - A study on the fed-batch semi-simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (FB-S-SSF) of sodium carbonate-pretreated rice straw at biomass loads between 10.0 and 30.0% (m/v) was conducted. Three different feeding modes, i.e., enzyme feeding (E feeding), substrate feeding (SR feeding) and the combination of both E feeding and SR feeding as well as batch mode were conducted for comparison under identical biomass loads. High ethanol concentrations above 90 g/L were obtained in all modes at a biomass load ≥25.0%. The SR feeding modes achieved higher final ethanol concentrations than those of the E feeding mode and batch mode. At biomass loads of 25.0%, 116.8 ± 3.3 and 118.9 ± 3.6 g/L ethanol was obtained for the SR feeding mode and the combination of E feeding and SR feeding modes, respectively. For batch mode and E feeding mode, the ethanol concentrations were 112.3 ± 3.6 and 108.6 ± 3.0 g/L, respectively. The present study shows that the production cost of bioethanol from lignocellulose can be reduced by adopting in situ-produced crude enzymes produced by Aspergillus fumigatus combined with FB-S-SSF of sodium carbonate-pretreated rice straw at a high biomass load, which provides a new idea for effectively reducing the production cost of bioethanol from lignocellulose. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nannochloropsis gaditana is a microalga, constituting cellulose 33 ± 1.3% and hemicellulose 18.2 ± 0.8%; used for the biofuel production. The cellulose in microalgal biomass would contribute to protecting the environment and constitute an attractive renewable raw material for bioethanol production. Ethanol production from N. gaditana microalgal biomass was investigated through Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) using Hangateiclostridium thermocellum KSMK1203 bacterial isolate. Screening and optimization of biomass pretreatment with different acids in different dosages, various hydrolysis time at 100 °C were performed and statistically validated using one-way ANOVA for efficient hemicellulose removal from NaClO2-treated N. gaditana biomass. Medium components and process parameters were statistically optimized by Response Surface Methodology. The maximum cellulase of 13.96 ± 1.354 IU/mL and ethanol of 12.90 ± 0.987 g/L were obtained in pretreated N.gaditana biomass. This study demonstrates that N. gaditana is a substitution for vegetal cellulose and these optimized conditions could be successfully used for commercial ethanol production using H. thermocellum KSMK1203. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is emerging as a promising microbial host for biotechnological industry due to its broad range of substrate affinity and resilience to physicochemical stresses. Its natural tolerance towards aromatics and solvents qualifies this versatile microbe as promising candidate to produce next generation biofuels such as isobutanol. In this study, we scaled-up the production of isobutanol with P. putida from shake flask to fed-batch cultivation in a 30 L bioreactor. The design of a two-stage bioprocess with separated growth and production resulted in 3.35 gisobutanol L–1. Flux analysis revealed that the NADPH expensive formation of isobutanol exceeded the cellular catabolic supply of NADPH finally causing growth retardation. Concomitantly, the cell counteracted to the redox imbalance by increased formation of 2-ketogluconic thereby providing electrons for the respiratory ATP generation. Thus, P. putida partially uncoupled ATP formation from the availability of NADH. The quantitative analysis of intracellular pyridine nucleotides NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H revealed elevated catabolic and anabolic reducing power during aerobic production of isobutanol. Additionally, the installation of micro-aerobic conditions during production doubled the integral glucose-to-isobutanol conversion yield to 60 mgisobutanol gglucose–1 while preventing undesired carbon loss as 2-ketogluconic acid. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In recent years, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been widely used in the production of biofuels and value-added chemicals. To stably express the target products, it is necessary to integrate multiple target genes into the chromosome of S. cerevisiae. CRISPR multi-copy integration technology relying on delta sites has been developed, but it often requires the help of high-throughput screening or resistance markers, resulting in non-replicability and high cost. This study aims to develop a low-cost and easy-to-use multi-copy integration tool in S. cerevisiae. Firstly, twenty-one Cas proteins from different microorganisms were tested in S. cerevisiae to find the functional Cas proteins with optimal cleavage ability. Results showed that eight Cas proteins can complete gene editing. However, most of the transformants have low copy numbers, which may be caused by high cutting efficiency exceeding the repair rate. Therefore, the effect of donor translocation order was further investigated. Results showed that 4 copies were obtained by donor first translocation. Then, the gene drive delta site integration system by the CRISPR system (GDi-CRISPR) was developed by combining gene drive principle and CRISPR system. To be clear, the gRNA was put into donor fragments. Then, both of them were integrated into the genome, which can drive further cutting and repair due to increasing number of gRNA. Instead of high-throughput screening or resistance pressure, 6 copies were obtained in only 5–6 days using the GDi-CRISPR system. It is expected to further advance the development of S. cerevisiae multi-copy integration tools. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The influence of Fe (Iron), Ni (Nickel) and Se (Selene), important cofactors for hydrogenase (hyd), was evaluated in the bioproduction of H2, volatile organic acids (VOA) and alcohols using Clostridium butyricum as inoculum and 5 g/L of cellulose, glucose or sugarcane bagasse (SCB) in batch reactors at 37 °C. Conditions A (25 μM Fe), B (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni), C (25 μM Fe + 1 μM Ni + 1 μM Se) and D (with no metal addition) using cellulose and glucose were performed to optimize the culture medium. H2 production was favored in condition A being around 16 mmol/L and 6 mmol/L for glucose and cellulose, respectively. The predominance of butyric acid was observed in all experimental series with cellulose and glucose. On the other hand, acetic acid was predominant in the SCB assay. The presence of other bacteria in SCB may have contributed to the change in the route of the final metabolites. The results suggested the possibility of improving H2 and OA production by C. butyricum supplementing the medium with Fe using SCB as substrate source. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sponges with large protein adsorption capacity are highly desired in various fields such as biosensors, biofuel cells, biocatalysis, and protein chromatography. However, the use of environmentally friendly materials and mass production still face enormous challenges. Herein, a novel and facile method to fabricate an environmentally friendly monolithic cellulose/chitosan composite sponge (CECSS) with remarkable performance is designed using the mature viscose process. The obtained highly efficient adsorption sponge exhibits a hierarchical porous structure with open-pore structures with a diameter range of 200-1000 μm and small micro/nanocellular structures (0.5-2 μm), which endow it with remarkable porosity (62.95%) and water adsorption capacity (1409%). Based on the abovementioned unique porous structure and reactive groups of chitosan, the CECSS exhibits a high bovine serum albumin adsorption capacity of 200.56 mg/g at pH 5.5 for 10 h. In addition, the adsorption of the CECSS can be well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model. This work provides a new sponge-forming process for the fields of protein adsorption, which may achieve the production of natural protein adsorbents at the industrial level. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The performance of biofuel cells (BFCs) depends on the number of electrons that can be harvested from one fuel molecule by the bioanode, as well as many other factors. Regular, one-enzyme bioanodes can usually harvest two electrons per fuel molecule, lowering the conversion efficiency of chemical energy stored in the fuel to electrical energy. In this study, we successfully develop a high-performance BFC with a two-enzyme bioanode that can harvest four electrons by oxidizing lactate to acetylphosphate through a two-step enzymatic reaction that uses lactate oxidase (LOx) and pyruvate oxidase (POx). A current of 1 mA is obtained from the BFC for 2500 s, with only a slight decrease in the cell voltage, reaching 0 V at 3010 s. During this time, a total of 1253 mJ is harvested. This is approximately 1.8-fold the time and double the energy that is obtained from a corresponding one-enzyme-bioanode BFC employing only LOx, thus confirming that twice the number of electrons are harvested per lactate molecule. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass from plants has been used as a biofuel source and the potent acidic endoglucanase GtCel12A has been isolated from Gloeophyllum trabeum, a filamentous fungus. In this study, we established a plant-based platform for the production of active GtCel12A fused to family 3 cellulose-binding module (CBM3). We used the signal sequence of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal for the accumulation of the produced GtCel12A in the ER. To achieve enhanced enzyme expression, we incorporated the M-domain of the human receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C into the construct. In addition, to enable the removal of N-terminal domains that are not necessary after protein expression, we further incorporated the cleavage site of Brachypodium distachyon small ubiquitin-like modifier. The GtCel12A-CBM3 fusion protein produced in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana exhibited not only high solubility but also efficient endoglucanase activity on the carboxymethyl cellulose substrate as determined by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid assay. The endoglucanase activity of GtCel12A-CBM3 was maintained even when immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose beads. Taken together, these results indicate that GtCel12A endoglucanase produced in plants might be used to provide monomeric sugars from lignocellulosic biomass for bioethanol production. © Copyright © 2021 Geem, Song, Hwang, Bae and Lee.

AB  - Mushroom cultivation along with the palm oil industry in Malaysia have contributed to large volumes of accumulated lignocellulosic residues that cause serious environmental pollution when these agroresidues are burned. In this study, we illustrated the utilization of lignocellulolytic enzymes from the spent mushroom substrate of Pleurotus pulmonarius for the hydrolysis of palm oil mill effluent (POME). The hydrolysate was used for the production of biohydrogen gas and enzyme assays were carried out to determine the productivities/activities of lignin peroxidase, laccase, xylanase, endoglucanase and β-glucosidase in spent mushroom substrate. Further, the enzyme cocktails were concentrated for the hydrolysis of POME. Central composite design of response surface methodology was performed to examine the effects of enzyme loading, incubation time and pH on the reducing sugar yield. Productivities of the enzymes for xylanase, laccase, endoglucanase, lignin peroxidase and β-glucosidase were 2.3, 4.1, 14.6, 214.1, and 915.4 U g-1, respectively. A maximum of 3.75 g/l of reducing sugar was obtained under optimized conditions of 15 h incubation time with 10% enzyme loading (v/v) at a pH of 4.8, which was consistent with the predicted reducing sugar concentration (3.76 g/l). The biohydrogen cumulative volume (302.78 ml H2.L-1 POME) and 83.52% biohydrogen gas were recorded using batch fermentation which indicated that the enzymes of spent mushroom substrate can be utilized for hydrolysis of POME.

AB  - The broad applications of implantable glucose biofuel cells (GBFCs) have become very attractive in biomedical sciences. The key challenge of GBFCs is eliminating the inevitable product H2O2 generated from the oxidation of glucose when glucose oxidase (GOx) is used as a catalyst while improving the performance of GBFCs. In this work, the cascade electrocatalyst, RBCs@NPDA was obtained through the in situ polymerization of dopamine to form nanopolydopamine (NPDA) on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). The RBCs@NPDA can catalyze both fuels of H2O2 and O2, so as to generate a high cathodic current (0.414 mA cm-2). Furthermore, when RBCs@NPDA was used as a cathodic catalyst in the membraneless GBFC, it exhibited the cascade catalytic activity in the reduction of O2-H2O2 and minimized the damage to RBCs caused by the high concentration of H2O2. The mechanism research indicates that RBCs@NPDA integrates the property of NPDA and RBCs. Specifically, NPDA plays a catalase-like role in catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2, while RBCs play a laccase-like role in electrocatalyzing the O2 reduction reaction. This work offers the cascade catalyst for improving the performance of implantable GBFC and presents a strategy for constructing catalysts using living cells and nanomaterials to replace deformable and unstable enzymes in other biofuel cells. ©

AB  - Enzymes are promising electrocatalysts in many biological processes. We proposed two strategies, co-immobilization and three-dimensional (3D) space design, to strengthen electron transfer (ET). In this research, DNA base and CNT were mixed in an aqueous solution; then the mixture was dried and ground. Finally, the powder was annealed in N2 to obtain DNA derived N-doped 3D conductive network (N-G@CNT). N-G@CNT immobilized mediators on itself through adsorption. Such 3D space structure shows high activity toward a set of critical electrochemical reactions and high-performance in enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). It is found that N-G@CNT conductive network possesses an interconnected porous structure and well-developed porosity. As a result, the membrane-less EBFCs equipped with enzyme/mediator co-immobilization N-G@CNT bioelectrodes were measured in a model 5 mM glucose-containing aqueous solution, human serum, and rabbit whole blood, respectively, which can generate 0.34, 0.078, and 0.15 mW cm−2 power density, respectively. The constant-current discharge method carried out in a model 5 mM glucose-containing aqueous solution shows that the discharge time reached 19 h at a discharge current density of 0.01 mA cm−2. The membrane EBFCs can deliver a high open circuit voltage of 0.68 V, a short-circuit current density of 2 mA cm−2, and a maximum power density of 0.5 mW cm−2. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent works have established bio-based carboxylic acids as adaptable precursors to renewable biofuels and chemicals. However, the separation of carboxylic acids is a major energy and cost driver, accounting for 20-40% of the entire processing cost. Improved downstream separation technologies that reduce operating costs compared to conventional approaches are needed, particularly to enable bio-based commodity fuels and chemicals. Here, we combine techno-economic analysis (TEA) and an energy and environmental assessment with experimental results to compare weak-base adsorption (WBA) processes with the conventional strong ion exchange (IX) process for the recovery of the exemplary product, butyric acid. TEA indicates that WBA has the potential to reduce operating expenses from 34% to 6% relative to the selling price of butyric acid ($1.8 kg−1). Our energy analysis shows that the WBA process has 12.2-fold energy reduction and 9.2-fold GHG emission reduction compared to the conventional IX process. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 OleT is a fatty acid decarboxylase that catalyzes the production of olefins with biofuel and synthetic applications. However, the relatively sluggish catalytic efficiency of the enzyme limits its applications. Here, we report the application of a novel class of benzene containing small molecules to improve the OleT activity. The UV-Vis spectroscopy study and molecular docking results confirmed the high proximity of the small molecules to the heme group of OleT. Up to 6-fold increase of product yield has been achieved in the small molecule-modulated enzymatic reactions. Our work thus sheds the light to the application of small molecules to increase the OleT catalytic efficiency, which could be potentially used for future olefin productions. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Dynamic metabolic engineering that harnesses synthetic biological tools is a next-generation strategy for microbial chemical and fuel production. We previously reported a synthetic quorum sensing system combined with a metabolic toggle switch (QS-MTS) in E. coli. It autonomously redirected endogenous metabolic flux toward the synthetic metabolic pathway and improved biofuel production. However, its functions and effects on host metabolism were attenuated by induction timing delay. Here, we redesigned the QS-MTS to stabilize QS signaling efficiency and metabolic regulation. We performed a metabolome analysis to clarify the effects of QS-MTS redesign on host metabolism. We compared the contributions of conventional and redesigned QS-MTS to fed-batch fermentation. The redesigned QS-MTS was more conducive than the conventional QS-MTS to long-term processes such as fed-batch fermentation. Here, we present a circuit redesign for metabolic flux control based on dynamic characteristic evaluation and metabolome analysis. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Energy crisis and global climate change have driven an increased effort toward biofuel synthesis from renewable feedstocks. Herein, purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium (PNSB) of Rhodobacter capsulatus was explored as a platform for high-titer production of a terpene-based advanced biofuel-bisabolene. A multilevel engineering strategy such as promoter screening, improving the NADPH availability, strengthening the precursor supply, suppressing the side pathways, and introducing a heterologous mevalonate pathway, was used to improve the bisabolene titer in R. capsulatus. The above strategies enabled a 35-fold higher titer of bisabolene than that of the starting strain, reaching 1089.7 mg/L from glucose in a shake flask. The engineered strain produced 9.8 g/L bisabolene with a yield of >0.196 g/g-glucose under the two-phase fed-batch fermentation, which corresponds to >78% of theoretical maximum. Taken together, our work represents one of the pioneering studies to demonstrate PNSB as a promising platform for terpene-based advanced biofuel production. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - 1-Octanol has gained interest as a chemical precursor for both high and low value commodities including fuel, solvents, surfactants, and fragrances. By harnessing the power from sunlight and CO2 as carbon source, cyanobacteria has recently been engineered for renewable production of 1-octanol. The productivity, however, remained low. In the present work, we report efforts to further improve the 1-octanol productivity. Different N-terminal truncations were evaluated on three thioesterases from different plant species, resulting in several candidate thioesterases with improved activity and selectivity toward octanoyl-ACP. The structure/function trials suggest that current knowledge and/or state-of-the art computational tools are insufficient to determine the most appropriate cleavage site for thioesterases in Synechocystis. Additionally, by tuning the inducer concentration and light intensity, we further improved the 1-octanol productivity, reaching up to 35% (w/w) carbon partitioning and a titer of 526 ± 5 mg/L 1-octanol in 12 days. Long-term cultivation experiments demonstrated that the improved strain can be stably maintained for at least 30 days and/or over ten times serial dilution. Surprisingly, the improved strain was genetically stable in contrast to earlier strains having lower productivity (and hence a reduced chance of reaching toxic product concentrations). Altogether, improved enzymes and environmental conditions (e.g., inducer concentration and light intensity) substantially increased the 1-octanol productivity. When cultured under continuous conditions, the bioproduction system reached an accumulative titer of >3.5 g/L 1-octanol over close to 180 days. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Clostridium tyrobutyricum (C. tyrobutyricum) is a fermentation strain used to produce butyric acid. A promising new biofuel, n-butanol, can be produced by catalysis of butyrate, which can be obtained through microbial fermentation. Butyric acid has various uses in food additives and flavor agents, antiseptic substances, drug formulations, and fragrances. Its use as a food flavoring has been approved by the European Union, and it has therefore been listed on the EU Lists of Flavorings. As butyric acid fermentation is a cost-efficient process, butyric acid is an attractive feedstock for various biofuels and food commercialization products. 12C6+ irradiation has advantages over conventional mutation methods for fermentation production due to its dosage conformity and excellent biological availability. Nevertheless, the effects of these heavy-ion irradiations on the specific productiveness of C. tyrobutyricum are still uncertain. We developed non-structured mathematical models to represent the heavy-ion irradiation of C. tyrobutyricum in biofermentation reactors. The kinetic models reflect various fermentation features of the mutants, including the mutant strain growth model, butyric acid formation model, and medium consumption model. The models were constructed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo model and logistic regression. Models were verified using experimental data in response to different initial glucose concentrations (0–180 g/L). The parameters of fixed proposals are applied in the various fermentation stages. Predictions of these models were in accordance well with the results of fermentation assays. The maximum butyric acid production was 56.3 g/L. Our study provides reliable information for increasing butyric acid production and for evaluating the feasibility of using mutant strains of C. tyrobutyricum at the pre-development phase. © Copyright © 2021 Cao, Gao, Wang, Shu, Hu, Xie, Cui, Guo and Zhou.

AB  - Methane is a type of renewable fuel that can generate many types of high value-added chemicals, however, besides heat and power production, there is little methane utilization in most of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) all round the world currently. In this review, the status of methane production performance from WWTPs was firstly investigated. Subsequently, based on the identification and classification of methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB), the key enzymes and metabolic pathway of MOB were presented in depth. Then the production, extraction and purification process of high value-added chemicals, including methanol, ectoine, biofuel, bioplastic, methane protein and extracellular polysaccharides, were introduced in detail, which was conducive to understand the bioconversion process of methane. Finally, the use of methane in wastewater treatment process, including nitrogen removal, emerging contaminants removal as well as resource recovery was extensively explored. These findings could provide guidance in the development of sustainable economy and environment, and facilitate biological methane conversion by using MOB in further attempts. © 2021

AB  - Xylan is an abundant hemicellulosic feedstock of pentose sugars present in the Lignocellulose biomass, offering massive potential for the generation of biofuel and numerous value-added by-products. The extraction of xylan is a major challenge due to the typical organization of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Ionic Liquid (IL) is a promising solvent for the deconstruction of the complex lignocellulosic structure. However, the residual IL present in the pretreated xylan significantly affects xylanase activity during the hydrolysis. Thus, a molecular understanding focusing on the IL-xylanase interaction needs to be explored for developing IL tolerant xylanases for efficient xylan hydrolysis. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the IL tolerance of hyperthermophilic GH10B xylanase from Thermotoga maritima (TmXYN10B) in both aqueous and water/1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EmimAc) binary solvent systems. The enzyme was stable in all solvents at high temperature (363 K). However, the opening and closing motions of the xylanase were lost in high EmimAc concentration. Besides, the formation of a considerable number of hydrogen bonds between acetate anion and amino acids at the enzyme surface might change its native motion in high EmimAc system. The IL induced conformational change was charecterized by constructing Protein Structure Network (PSN) on each snapshot from the MD simulation trajectory. Here we captured the enzyme conformational change by identifying disjoint cliques and communities at the active site in high EmimAc concentration. Furthermore, Emim cations populated the active site with higher binding occupancy and suggested to inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis. Finally, this study provides a theoretical understanding of the reduced activity of the TmXYN10B xylanase in IL, which can pave the path for engineering xylanases for biofuel production. © 2021

AB  - Establishing a suitable immobilization strategy to improve the accessibility of immobilized cellulase for insoluble cellulose and subsequently recover the enzyme from the remaining substrate is crucial to promote the industrialization of biofuels. Here, using iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and Ni2+ ions, a novel metal-chelated copolymer of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate was prepared for the immobilization of His-tagged processive endoglucanase EG5C-1 via affinity interaction between polyhistidine tag and Ni2+. The optimum loading capacity of the functionalized polymer (Eud-IDA-Ni2+) for EG5C-1 was about 280 mg/g, where more than 80% of the activity was recovered. Immobilized EG5C-1 exhibited improved thermal and pH stability and better reusability than the free one, and after five cycles of usage, the hydrolysis productivity remained above 70% of the initial value. The Eud-IDA-Ni2+/EG5C-1 biocomposite displayed reversibly soluble-insoluble characteristics with pH change, which was in the soluble state during the enzyme reaction process but could be recovered in an insoluble form by lowering the pH after the reaction. Thus, the yield obtained from the hydrolysis of an insoluble phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose substrate was similar for the free and immobilized form of EG5C-1. Our combined results suggested that a metal-ion-chelated, pH-responsive polymer had the potential for His-tagged cellulase immobilization to improve both the operational efficiency and economic benefit of the cellulosic biorefinery industry. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Lignin and hemicellulose structures in cellulosic materials serve as a barrier for enzyme reactions. A pretreatment step is often needed to break these components to allow the biomass to be utilized as a source of value-added products. Various available pretreatment methods possess common drawbacks of the high amount of liquid and chemical requirements, harsh process conditions, and the high amount of waste produced, which driving up the production costs of bioproducts. Low moisture anhydrous ammonia (LMAA) pretreatment capable of eliminating those drawbacks. In this study, Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS), corn gluten feed (CGF), corn fiber (CF), and oil palm frond (OPF) with different moisture contents were subjected to LMAA pretreatment at the specific ammonia loading rate, 1 h ammoniation, and 75°C incubation temperature. This pretreatment successfully decreased the lignin content of the materials, increased their percentage of α-cellulose, and improved enzymatic digestibility for most of the materials tested. The effect of moisture content (30 and 50% db) was found to be more significant than that of incubation time (24 and 72 h). © Copyright © 2021 Mahmud and Rosentrater.

AB  - Alternative and green sources of energy are needed to replace rapidly depleting and non-renewable fossil fuels. Abundant and renewable lignocellulose biomass can be transformed into value-added chemicals and biofuels that are currently derived from non-renewable fossil fuels. The conversion of lignocellulose biomass has been extensively investigated over heterogeneous catalysts via various catalytic processes. In particular, solid acid catalysts possessing both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites have drawn significant research interest. Among these catalysts, metal phosphates are of particular interest due to their relatively facile synthesis routes, low cost, environmental friendliness, and tunable Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. In this tutorial review, we have provided a brief overview of the synthesis methodologies and have summarized several catalytic processes involved in biomass upgrading, including dehydration, oxidation, transfer hydrogenation, transesterification, hydrogenolysis, and hydrodeoxygenation over metal phosphate catalysts to produce value-added chemicals and biofuels. The main emphasis is to highlight the relationship between the textural properties of the catalysts and their catalytic performances and to elucidate future research opportunities available in this exciting area. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Energy crisis in the world motivates countries to hire new and renewable energies. One of the main and valuable renewable sources of energy is agricultural waste. This is widely disposed of through the world during the harvest, packing, and transportation. In many countries, agricultural waste is considerably weighty. Nonetheless, most of that is used for animal feed or herbal fertilizer and no useful value is added. Despite its location in an arid region, Iran produces various citrus, cereals, and vegetables in high tonnage. The waste of the agricultural product, especially those disposed of by the food processing industries, such as fruit juice factories, remains also useless. The potential of the residues to extract biofuel is investigated in the current experimental study. Six samples of abundant agricultural products in Iran are chosen: sugarcane, grape, potato, orange peel, date, and mulberry. The processes of pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation are performed and the extracted juice is directed to the distiller to gather bioethanol. To evaluate the distilled juice purity, a gas chromatography test is carried out. It is shown that date and mulberry can produce a maximum of 29.5 and 23 ml (ethanol)/100 g (dry waste) as the most efficient agricultural products. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Plants naturally produce a terrific diversity of molecules, which we exploit for promoting our overall well-being. Plants are also green factories. Indeed, they may be exploited to biosynthesize bioactive molecules, proteins, carbohydrates and biopolymers for sustainable and large-scale production. These molecules are easily converted into commodities such as pharmaceuticals, antioxidants, food, feed and biofuels for multiple industrial processes. Novel plant biotechnological, genetics and metabolic insights ensure and increase the applicability of plant-derived compounds in several industrial sectors. In particular, synergy between disciplines, including apparently distant ones such as plant physiology, pharmacology, ‘omics sciences, bioinformatics and nanotechnology paves the path to novel applications of the so-called molecular farming. We present an overview of the novel studies recently published regarding these issues in the hope to have brought out all the interesting aspects of these published studies. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) is capable of performing enzymatic saccharification and fermentation for biofuel production in a single vessel. Thus, SSF has several advantages such as simplifying the manufacturing process, operating easily, and reducing energy input. Here, we describe the application of Pichia kudriavzevii NBRC1279 and NBRC1664 to SSF for bioethanol production. When each strain was incubated for 144 h at 35◦ C with Japanese cedar particles, the highest ethanol concentrations were reached 21.9 ± 0.50 g/L and 23.8 ± 3.9 g/L, respectively. In addition, 21.6 ± 0.29 g/L and 21.3 ± 0.21 g/L of bioethanol were produced from Japanese eucalyptus particles when each strain was incubated for 144 h at 30◦ C. Although previous methods require pretreatment of the source material, our method does not require pretreatment, which is an advantage for industrial use. To elucidate the different characteristics of the strains, we performed genome sequencing and genome comparison. Based on the results of the eggNOG categories and the resulting Venn diagram, the functional abilities of both strains were similar. However, strain NBRC1279 showed five retrotransposon protein genes in the draft genome sequence, which indicated that the stress tolerance of both strains is slightly different. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - With the development of agricultural biorefineries and bioprocessing operations, understanding the economic efficiencies and environmental impacts for these have gradually become popular for the deployment of these industrial processes. The corn-based ethanol and soybean oil refining industries have been examined extensively over the years, especially details of processing technologies, including materials, reaction controls, equipment, and industrial applications. The study focused on examining the production efficiency changes and economic impacts of integrating products from the enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction processing (EAEP) of soybeans into corn-based ethanol fermentation processing. Using SuperPro Designer to simulate production of corn-based ethanol at either 40 million gallons per year (MGY) or 120 MGY, with either oil separation or no oil removal, we found that indeed integrating soy products into corn ethanol fermentation may be slightly more expensive in terms of production costs, but economic returns justify this integration due to substantially greater quantities of ethanol, distillers corn oil, and distillers dried grains with solubles being produced. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - With a high potential to generate biomass, maize stover arises as an outstanding feedstock for biofuel production. Maize stover presents the added advantage of being a multiple exploitation of the crop as a source of food, feed, and energy. In this study, contrasting groups of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a maize multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population that showed variability for saccharification efficiency were screened by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy to explore compositional differences between high and low saccharification yielders. High and low saccharification efficiency groups differed in cell wall compositional features: high saccharification RILs displayed higher proportions of S subunits, aromatic compounds, and hemicellulose as opposed to low saccharification efficiency groups in which FTIR predicted higher proportions of lignin, more precisely lignin being richer in subunits G, and greater proportions of crystalline cellulose and acetyl methyl esters. The application of FTIR-ATR spectroscopy in this material allowed us to obtain a rapid and broad vision of cell wall compositional features in contrasting groups of saccharification efficiency. These results helped us to deepen our knowledge into the relationship between cell wall composition and biorefining potential; they also allowed us to establish new targets for future research regarding lignocellulosic bioconversion. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Thermal acid hydrolysis is the most common pretreatment method used to deal with waste lignocellulosic biomass. However, furan derivatives (5‑hydroxy-methylfurfural (5-HMF) and furfural) are unavoidably produced and influence downstream biofuel production. Biological methods are superior to physical and chemical methods in detoxifying 5-HMF and furfural because of economic concerns. Integrating the biodetoxification process into the lignocellulose pretreatment and downstream biofuel production procedure is an important issue. The previous novel strain Burkholderia cepacia H-2 capable of quickly degrading 5-HMF and furfural was applied in the biodetoxification process. In this study, the acid sorts and concentration effects on thermal acid rice straw hydrolysis were investigated first. Rice straw hydrolysates with various dilution ratios were then biodetoxified using on-site inoculating novel strain B. cepacia H-2. The biodetoxified rice straw hydrolysate was then used for biohydrogen production using dark fermentation. The highest hydrolysis efficiency and reducing sugar were 49% and 15.6 g/L, respectively when applying 0.5 M HCl to deal with 5% rice straw at 121°C for 15 min. The 5-HMF and furfural in the 2-fold diluted rice straw hydrolysate could be completely biodetoxified within 12 hrs. The hydrolysate hydrogen yields with and without biodetoxification were 0.90 and 0.64 mmol H2/mmol sugar, respectively. The biodetoxification process using the novel strain B. cepacia H-2 was successfully established and could be integrated into the lignocellulose pretreatment and downstream biofuel production procedure as using the rice straw as the feedstock. © 2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Olive trees constitute one of the largest agroindustries in the Mediterranean area, and their cultivation generates a diverse pool of biomass by-products such as olive tree pruning (OTP), olive leaves (OL), olive stone (OS), and extracted olive pomace (EOP). These lignocellulosic materials have varying compositions and potential utilization strategies within a biorefinery context. The aim of this work was to carry out an integral analysis of the aqueous extractives fraction of these biomasses. Several analytical methods were applied in order to fully characterize this fraction to varying extents: a mass closure of >80% was reached for EOP, >76% for OTP, >65% for OS, and >52% for OL. Among the compounds detected, xylooligosaccharides, mannitol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, and hydroxytyrosol were noted as potential enhancers of the valorization of said by-products. The extraction of these compounds is expected to be more favorable for OTP, OL, and EOP, given their high extractives content, and is compatible with other utilization strategies such as the bioconversion of the lignocellulosic fraction into biofuels and bioproducts. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - We report a liquid chromatography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous quantification of 131 intracellular bacterial metabolites of Clostridium autoethanogenum. A comprehensive mixture of uniformly 13C-labeled internal standards (U-13C IS) was biosynthesized from the closely related bacterium Clostridium pasteurianum using 4% 13C-glucose as a carbon source. The U-13C IS mixture combined with 12C authentic standards was used to validate the linearity, precision, accuracy, repeatability, limits of detection, and quantification for each metabolite. A robust-fitting algorithm was employed to reduce the weight of the outliers on the quantification data. The metabolite calibration curves were linear with R2 ≥ 0.99, limits of detection were ≤1.0 μM, limits of quantification were ≤10 μM, and precision/accuracy was within RSDs of 15% for all metabolites. The method was subsequently applied for the daily monitoring of the intracellular metabolites of C. autoethanogenum during a CO gas fermentation over 40 days as part of a study to optimize biofuel production. The concentrations of the metabolites were estimated at steady states of different pH levels using the robust-fitting mathematical approach, and we demonstrate improved accuracy of results compared to conventional regression. Metabolic pathway analysis showed that reactions of the incomplete (branched) tricarboxylic acid "cycle"were the most affected pathways associated with the pH shift in the bioreactor fermentation of C. autoethanogenum and the concomitant changes in ethanol production. © 2021 The Authors.

Comparative studies on the impact of the electrochemical functionalization of the SWNT electrodes on the device performance revealed a 40%-110% increase in power density as compared to that of the device with as-fabricated SWNT electrodes, with an observed maximum power density of 7.2 μW cm-2. This improvement in performance can be attributed to the increase in the amount of enzymes adsorbed on the SWNT surface and the enhanced electron transfer rate owing to the SWNT functionalization. Our findings can aid improve the performance of flexible and high-power-density biofuel cells. © 2021 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

AB  - Microalgae are considered one of the best resources for the production of biofuels and industrially important compounds. Various models have been developed to understand the fundamental mechanism underlying the accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs)/starch and to enhance its content in cells. Among various algae, the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae has been considered an excellent model system to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind the accumulation of TAG/starch in the microalga, as it has a smaller genome size and various biotechnological methods are available for it. Furthermore, C. merolae can grow and survive under high temperature (40◦C) and low pH (2–3) conditions, where most other organisms would die, thus making it a choice alga for large-scale production. Investigations using this alga has revealed that the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is involved in the accumulation of carbon-reserved molecules, TAGs, and starch. Furthermore, detailed molecular mechanisms of the role of TOR in controlling the accumulation of TAGs and starch were uncovered via omics analyses. Based on these findings, genetic engineering of the key gene and proteins resulted in a drastic increment of the amount of TAGs and starch. In addition to these studies, other trials that attempted to achieve the TAG increment in C. merolae have been summarized in this article. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The article deals with the recent developments in the fuel industry, considering the permanent increasing requirements for fuel quality and environmental safety. The work aims to study various technological modes at the rectification unit to produce fuel bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. The main goals are to solve applied scientific problems of rational designing and technological optimization to obtain boundaries of energy consumption to ensure the quality of bioethanol sufficient for a consumer. Recent approaches for numerical simulation of chemical technological processes were applied to study the operating processes and optimize technological parameters. The plant model was designed from various modules that allow us to simulate technological processes efficiently and accurately for all the primary units of the rectification equipment. The methodology based on the activity coefficient UNIFAC model of phase equilibrium was applied. As a result, a mixture with 74% of bioethanol 9% of impurities was obtained in the brew column. In the epuration column, a mixture of 46% bioethanol and 2.2% of impurities was obtained in bottoms. Finally, in the alcohol column, the mass fraction of distillate of 96.9% and impurities of 2.7% were reached. The numerical simulation results can be applied in recent fuel technologies and designing the corresponding biofuel plants. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Multifunctional biomass is able to provide more than one valuable product, and thus, it is attractive in the field of microbial biotechnology due to its economic feasibility. Carotenogenic yeasts are effective microbial factories for the biosynthesis of a broad spectrum of biomolecules that can be used in the food and feed industry and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as a source of biofuels. In the study, we examined the effect of different nitrogen sources, carbon sources and CN ratios on the co‐production of intracellular lipids, carotenoids, β–glucans and extracellular glycolipids. Yeast strain R. kratochvilovae CCY 20‐2‐26 was identified as the best co‐producer of lipids (66.7 ± 1.5% of DCW), exoglycolipids (2.42 ± 0.08 g/L), β‐glucan (11.33 ± 1.34% of DCW) and carotenoids (1.35 ± 0.11 mg/g), with a biomass content of 15.2 ± 0.8 g/L, by using the synthetic medium with potassium nitrate and mannose as a carbon source. It was shown that an increased C/N ratio positively affected the biomass yield and production of lipids and β‐glucans. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this study, we devised a biofuel cell (BFC) by impregnating sheet-like cellulose nanofiber (CNF) with liquid fuel (fructose) and sandwiching it with the electrodes, making the structure simple and compact. CNF was considered as a suitable material for BFC because it is biocompatible, has a large specific surface area, and exhibits excellent properties as a catalyst and an adsorbent. In this BFC device, graphene-coated carbon fiber woven cloth (GCFC) was used as the material for preparing the electrodes, and the amount of enzyme modification on the surface of each electrode was enhanced. Further, as the distance between the electrodes was same as the thickness of the sheet-shaped CNF, it facilitated the exchange of protons between the electrodes. Moreover, the cathode, which requires an oxidation reaction, was exposed to the atmosphere to enhance the oxygen uptake. The maximum power density of the CNF-type BFC was recorded as 114.5 μW/cm2 at a voltage of 293 mV. This is more than 1.5 times higher than that of the liquid-fuel-type BFC. When measured after 24 h, the maximum power density was recorded as 44.9 μW/cm2 at 236 mV, and the output was maintained at 39% of that observed at the beginning of the measurement. However, it is not the case with general BFCs, where the power generation after 24 h is less than 5%. Therefore, the CNF-type BFCs have a longer lifespan and are fuel efficient. © 2021 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, two modification methods that employ graphene-coated carbon fiber woven fabric (GCFC) as an electrode and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) as a mediator were used to evaluate cathode performance. In addition, a prototype of an atmosphere-exposed ascorbic-acid enzyme biofuel cell (AAEBFC) consisting of an improved GCFC cathode and ABTS was evaluated. No modification was made in the anode region, and only the cathode region was coated with the enzyme of bilirubin oxidase (BOD). As a result of implementing an ABTS-modified cathode in the AAEBFC, an output of 721 μW/cm2was obtained at 0.189 V. When the gel thickness was changed, an output of 1200 μW/cm2was obtained at 0.17 V. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the highest reported output for an AAEBFC fueled by ascorbic acid. © 2021 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

AB  - Improvement of output and lifetime is a problem for biofuel cells. A structure was adopted in which gelation mixed with agarose and fuel (fructose) was sandwiched by electrodes made of graphene-coated carbon fiber. The cathode surface not contacting the gel was exposed to air. In addition, the anode surface not contacting the gel was in contact with fuel liquid to prevent the gel from being dry. The power density of the fuel cell was improved by increasing oxygen supply from air and the lifetime was improved by maintaining wet gel, that is, the proposed structure was a hybrid type having advantages of both fuel gel and fuel liquid. The output increased almost up to that of just using fuel gel and did not decrease significantly over time. The maximum power density in the proposed system was approximately 74.0 μW/cm2, an enhancement of approximately 1.5 times that in the case of using liquid fuel. The power density after 24 was approximately 46.1 μW/cm2, which was 62% of the initial value. © 2021 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuel cells (BFCs) using graphene-coated carbon fiber cloth electrodes and glucose gel fuel were fabricated and evaluated. A new structure using fuel gel, in which the anode was embedded in gel and the cathode was exposed to the atmosphere, was adopted. Air-exposed biofuel cells using gel have already been reported, however, adhesion between the anode and the gel was improved by the proposed structure. In addition, the enlargement of the gel area prevented its drying. These innovations improved the power density and lifetime of the BFCs. The anode was modified with a glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme and a mediator (ferrocene) and the cathode was modified with a bilirubin oxidase enzyme. The power density of the proposed structure was 176.4 μW/cm2at 0.19 V, which was approximately 3.8 times higher than that of BFCs using liquid fuel (45.9 μW/cm2). © 2021 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE.

AB  - This work demonstrates the application of magnetic carbon‐encapsulated iron nanoparticles (CEINs) for the construction of bioelectrodes in a biobattery and a biofuel cell. It has been shown that carbon‐encapsulated iron nanoparticles are a suitable material for the immobilization of laccase (Lc) and 1,4‐naphthoquinone (NQ) and fructose dehydrogenase (FDH). The system is stable; no leaching of the enzyme and mediator from the surface of the modified electrode was observed. The onset of the catalytic reduction of oxygen to water was at 0.55 V, and catalytic fructose oxidation started at −0.15 V. A biobattery was developed in which a zinc plate served as the anode, and the cathode was a glassy carbon electrode modified with carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticles, laccase in the Nafion (Nf) layer. The maximum power of the cell was ca. 7 mW/cm2 at 0.71 V and under external resistance of 1 kΩ. The open‐circuit voltage (OCV) for this system was 1.51 V. In the biofuel cell, magnetic nanoparticles were used both on the bioanode and biocathode to immobilize the enzymes. The glassy carbon bioanode was coated with carbon‐encapsulated iron nanoparticles, 1,4‐naphthoquinone, fructose dehydrogenase, and Nafion. The cathode was modified with carbon‐encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles and laccase in the Nafion layer. The biofuel cell parameters were as follows: maximum power of 78 μW/cm2 at the voltage of 0.33 V and under 20 kΩ resistance, and the open‐circuit voltage was 0.49 V. These enzymes worked effectively in the biofuel cell, and laccase also effectively worked in the biobattery. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of steam pretreatment using distilled water or waste glycerol as solvents to produce soluble sugars via enzymatic hydrolysis of palm empty fruit bunch (PEFB). Subsequently, two yeast species (S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis) were introduced to stimulate the fermentation of the soluble sugars to ethanol. The fermentable sugar (glucose plus xylose) concentration generated during hydrolysis of pretreated PEFB was found to be mainly a function of the pretreatment conditions (i.e. type of solvent, liquid-phase pH, and reaction time) as well as the hydrolysis time. Glucose was the major component of fermentable sugar in all tests; while the xylose content fluctuated from 3 to over 40% of that of glucose, with the higher percentages obtained at the shortest pretreatment time. The use of alkaline waste glycerol (pH 11) as a solvent during pretreatment resulted in optimum hydrolysis with a mean fermentable sugar concentration of 51.5 ± 4.1 g/L, while the corresponding mean value of the waste glycerol tests (pH 8.3) was 35.3 ± 4.9 g/L. Regarding fermentation, alkaline waste glycerol pretreatment enhanced ethanol production by over 50% compared to distilled water. It was also observed that fermentation using a S. cerevisiae monoculture was more effective than that of an equivalent co-culture. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae have been considered third generation feedstock for biofuel production based on the expectation that large amounts of algal biomass can be cultivated at an acceptable cost. Transformation of biomass into ethanol requires a saccharification step, where complex carbohydrates are broken down by hydrolysis into sugars that can be fermented to bioethanol. Carbohydrate mobilization is hampered by the recalcitrance of the cell envelope of microalgal cells, because complex structural polysaccharides are difficult to depolymerize and make internal carbohydrate reserves inaccessible to hydrolysis. Saccharification can be accomplished by either acidic hydrolysis, enzymatic treatment or a combination of both. The present work focused on the chemo-enzymatic hydrolysis of lyophilized biomass of different microalgae and subsequent fermentation of hydrolysates with higher reducing sugar content. A chemo-enzymatic hydrolysis strategy was defined, consisting of an acid pretreatment carried out at high pressure and temperature, followed by incubation with Amyloglucosidase and finally by incubation with α-Amylase, the opposite order of the conventional use of these enzymes. An increase of reducing sugar yield of about one third was observed, and this strategy was successfully applied to a broad group of microalgae, resulting in maximum release yields of at least 34.0 ± 1.0 g total reducing sugar/100 g dry biomass. For bioethanol production studies, the microalgae hydrolysates of Chlorella sorokiniana, Tetraselmis sp. (Necton) and Skeletonema sp. were selected according to their high reducing sugar content. High ethanol production was achieved with all hydrolysates, with ethanol yields close to the theoretical maximum and the highest ethanol concentrations so far reported under comparable conditions. Chlorella sorokiniana stood out as the best hydrolysate for ethanol production, with an ethanol yield of 0.464 ± 0.013 g/g reducing sugar and ethanol productivity of 0.344 ± 0.020 g/ L.h. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the microbial community of decaying wood, yeasts are important for the recycling of nutrients. Nevertheless, information on their biodiversity in this niche in the Northern hemisphere is limited. Wood-colonising yeasts encounter identical and similar growth-inhibitory compounds as those in spent sulphite liquor (SSL), an energy-rich, acid hydrolysate and waste product from the paper industry, which may render them well-suited for cultivation in SSL. In the present study, yeasts were isolated from decaying wood on the Faroe Islands and identified based on sequence homology of the ITS and D1/D2 regions. Among the yeasts isolated, Candida argentea, Cystofilobasidium infirmominiatum, Naganishia albidosimilis, Naganishia onofrii, Holtermanniella takashimae and Goffeauzyma gastrica were new to decaying wood in cold and temperate climates. C. argentea and Rhodotorula are rarely-isolated species, with no previous documentation from cold and maritime climates. The isolates were further tested for growth in a medium with increasing concentrations of softwood SSL. Most grew in the presence of 10% SSL. Isolates of Debaryomyces sp., C. argentea and Rhodotorula sp. were the most tolerant. Representatives of Debaryomyces and Rhodotorula have previously been found in decaying wood. In contrast, the least tolerant isolates belonged to species that are rarely reported from decaying wood. The relative importance of individual inhibitors to yeast growth is discussed. To our knowledge, none of the present yeast species have previously been cultivated in SSL medium. Decaying wood can be a useful future source of yeasts for valorisation of various hydrolysates to industrial chemicals and biofuels. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - To assess the role of Euglena gracilis mitochondrial metabolism on the degradation of organic matter present in liquid waste, heterotrophic cells were cultured in the presence of waste supernatants (waste-SN) from eukaryotic (human cancer, human parasite) cell growth media, which are rich in protein and micronutrients, as well as metabolic end-products such as ethanol and glucose. Prior treatment of waste-SN with papain was required to provide free amino acids, which E. gracilis cells actively consumed. Under aerobiosis, biomass production and contents of paramylon, total protein and relevant metabolites were similar for waste-SN, glutamate+malate (GM)- and glucose-grown cells. However, under microaerophilia, fatty acids (potentially useable as biofuels) and alpha-tocopherol contents were higher in waste-SN grown cells. Decreased metabolite contents and cell growth were attained after cell incubation with either azide, oxalate or rotenone. Aminotransferase activities, CO2 production (Krebs cycle), O2-uptake (respiratory chain) and formation of transmembrane electrochemical H+ gradient in isolated mitochondria from waste-SN grown cells were of similar magnitude to those displayed by mitochondria isolated from GM-grown cells. Data indicated that organic matter waste (such as ethanol and amino acids such as glutamate, glutamine and proline) can be oxidized by mitochondria and used as a carbon source for synthesis of vitamin E and other biotechnological relevant metabolites by E. gracilis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: A modified TEMPO-catalyzed oxidation of the solvent-exposed glucosyl units of cellulose to uronic acids, followed by carboxyl reduction with NaBD4 to 6-deutero- and 6,6-dideuteroglucosyl units, provided a robust method for determining relative proportions of disordered amorphous, ordered surface chains, and anhydrous core-crystalline residues of cellulose microfibrils inaccessible to TEMPO. Both glucosyl residues of cellobiose units, digested from amorphous chains of cellulose with a combination of cellulase and cellobiohydrolase, were deuterated, whereas those from anhydrous chains were undeuterated. By contrast, solvent-exposed and anhydrous residues alternate in surface chains, so only one of the two residues of cellobiosyl units was labeled. Although current estimates indicate that each cellulose microfibril comprises only 18 to 24 (1 → 4)-β-d-glucan chains, we show here that microfibrils of walls of Arabidopsis leaves and maize coleoptiles, and those of secondary wall cellulose of cotton fibers and poplar wood, bundle into much larger macrofibrils, with 67 to 86% of the glucan chains in the anhydrous domain. These results indicate extensive bundling of microfibrils into macrofibrils occurs during both primary and secondary wall formation. We discuss how, beyond lignin, the degree of bundling into macrofibrils contributes an additional recalcitrance factor to lignocellulosic biomass for enzymatic or chemical catalytic conversion to biofuel substrates.

AB  - The most plentiful carbohydrate present on earth is in the form of cellulose which has a tremendous capacity to manufacture second or third-generation biofuels and other valuable metabolites. Cellulose is a significant part of banana pseudostem (BP) squander that causes numerous environmental issues. Hence, disposal of BP is nowadays a major obstacle for Indian farmers because of immense volume, delay in decay raise in a foul smell during debasement which attracts pests and insects to farm. The present study reports the identification of potential isolates, which efficiently debase BP. Out of many isolates, NAULH-4 showed the uppermost decomposition rate of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin at 45 °C and pH 8 up to 28 days incubation. Moreover, the taxonomic characterization using phenotypic microarray (PM) technology directs that the isolate NAULH-4 belongs to Bacillus with 0.71 SIM index in metabolic pathway network which is reinforced by 16 s rRNA analysis. Molecular data reveal that NAULH-4 contain laccase, xylanase, and cellulase gene. Overall, Bacillus wakoensis NAULH-4 can be applicable for promising microbe for the conversion of BP waste into value-added metabolites. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although the process of microbial degradation of coal to produce biomethane has got much attention from many research works, the products profiles of coal at the initial stage of methanogenic bioconversion are not clear yet. In this study, five coal-degrading bacterial strains (CD1, CD10, CD20, CD24, and CD25) from a methanogenic community were isolated and identified. Among them, CD1 and CD24 belong to Paenibacillus sp., CD10 and CD20 belong to Bacillus sp., and CD25 belongs to Stenotrophomonas sp. After biotreatment of lignite and bituminous coal, the kinds of newly produced compounds were 33 and 45, respectively. Metabolomics analysis showed that a large number of alkane compounds and heterocyclic aromatic compounds were produced after degradation of bituminous coal and lignite by isolated bacteria, and most of the compounds had been produced in a hydroxylated or acylated manner, indicating that the initial microbial treatment enhanced the bioavailability of coal. Some alkaloids and biosurfactants were also detected in the aforementioned products, such as glycerophosphocholine, proveratrol A, proveratrol B, surfactin, etc. These microbial metabolites may play an important role in solubilization during the degradation of coal. This study added to the understanding of the complicated metabolic process of methanogenic coal bioconversion and enabled effective production of biomethane with appropriate metabolic strategies. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The cyanobacterial phycobiliproteins (PBPs) are an important natural colorant for nutraceutical industries. Here, a multi-objective hybrid machine learning-based optimization approach was used for enhanced cell biomass and PBPs production simultaneously in Nostoc sp. CCC-403. A central composite design (CCD) was employed to design an experimental setup for four input parameters, including three BG-11 medium components and pH. We achieved a 61.76% increase in total PBPs production and an almost 90% increase in cell biomass by our prediction model. We also established a test genome-scale metabolic network (GSMN) for Nostoc sp. and identified potential metabolic fluxes contributing to PBPs enhanced production. This study highlights the advantage of the hybrid machine learning approach and GSMN to achieve optimization for more than one objective and serves as the foundation for future efforts to convert cyanobacteria as an economically viable source for biofuels and natural products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) (E.C. 1.1.99.18) is a biomass degrading enzyme secreted by various cellulolytic fungi. It has applications in renewable biofuel production, biosensor, bioremediation, lactose determination in food, bleaching of pulp, biomedical applications etc. This paper describes cloning of a previously characterised gene from the published transcriptome data of a fungus Termitomyces clypeatus, its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its molecular and biochemical characterisation etc. which ultimately led us to conclude that the gene in fact codes for a CDH at biochemical level. The full length cDNA exhibited 2523 nucleotides and the deduced protein sequence consists of 840 amino acids. Genomic DNA analysis has revealed presence of four introns within this gene. The protein contains 4 putative N-glycosylation and 14 putative O-glycosylation sites. Cloning and molecular characterisation of this gene opens yet another new source of CDH enzyme for commercial exploitation by industry in future. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Endoglucanase, particularly those, which can withstand extreme conditions are in demand in different industrial settings. In this direction, a halophilic cellulolytic bacterial strain EN1 was isolated from decomposed wood particles of India’s largest inland hypersaline Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence homology, the bacterium was identified as Salisediminibacterium halotolerans. It constitutively secretes extracellular endoglucanase in heterotrophic culture supernatant supplemented with or without carboxy-methyl cellulose. EN1 endoglucanase is active at pH 8.0–11.0, and 10–30% NaCl with optimum values of pH 11.0, and 25% NaCl. Under these optimum conditions, the enzyme retained up to 90% activity for 8 h. Activity was enhanced by some metal ions (5 mM) in order of Cu2+ (273%), Ni2+ (139%) and Fe2+ (125%); and decreased by Mg2+ (72%) and EDTA (56%). The enzyme was stable in different organic solvents (30% v/v), namely ethanol (108%), hexane (95%), methanol (93%), and iso-propanol (92%). The endoglucanase was effectively used for in situ saccharification of alkali-pretreated rice straw with 50 µg mL−1 reducing ends released after 120 h. These unique features of the extracellular endoglucanase reported for the first time from the genera Salisediminibacterium indicate its prospects in different industrial settings particularly for bioethanol production. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

AB  - Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L) is a C4 plant, and it recently has emerged as a model feedstock for biofuel production. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known as key regulators in different biological processes in plant including sugar accumulation. Despite bioinformatics analyses for the discovery of miRNAs and prediction of targets in recent years, little information is available on the expression of mature candidate miRNAs and biological validation of their targets in sweet sorghum. This study aims to gain an insight on the conserved and novel miRNAs as well as their potential targets associated with biofuel related traits, with the help of next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by RT-qPCR validation. In order to identify biofuel related miRNAs and their potential targets in sweet sorghum, small RNA libraries were constructed from four varieties, i.e., Achi Turi, Dale, Dasht Local, and Topper 76-6 after being grown under controlled conditions, and sequenced by Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. Sequencing yield from 12 libraries, 3 from each variety i.e., leaf vegetative stage, leaf reproductive stage and stem reproductive stage, ranged from 19 to 48 million reads. Mapping with Sorghum bicolor ensemble genome while aligned with miRBase-release 21, 276 conserved and novel biofuel relevant miRNAs were predicted in all varieties. Target prediction by employing psRNA Target tool indicated 475 biofuel relevant targets for identified conserved and novel miRNAs. We performed the RT-qPCR analysis on selected 36 candidate mature miRNAs along with their 18 targets. Potential biofuel relevant targets identified in our study included the sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), sucrose synthase (SUS), sucrose transporters (SUT) and invertase (INV) enzymes, which are believed to play key role in sucrose synthesis, accumulation and transport. Altogether, 19 predicted miRNAs and their 15 target mRNAs showed significant change in expression under the three growth stages of four varieties. Significant down-regulation at reproductive stage was observed with Sbi-miR160, Sbi-miR164, Sbi-miR166 and Sbi-miR168 in most of the varieties while significant upregulation was observed for Sbi-miR156a and Sbi-miR156e during vegetative stages. This study showed a positive as well as negative correlations between levels of miRNA expressions and that of their target mRNAs. These findings, both computational and experimental, provide valuable insights on the role of miRNAs and their targets during sugar accumulation stages. The identification of these significantly expressed miRNAs and their targets will help to explore the molecular mechanisms for sugar accumulation in sweet sorghum. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To develop a method for direct transesterification of wet yeast using immobilized lipase, the oleaginous yeast Saitozyma podzolica Zwy-2-3 and the lipase producing Burkholderia pyrrolica WZ10-3 were used as materials for production of biodiesel. Fe3O4@SiO2-CHO prepared by modifying Fe3O4 with TEOS, APTES and glutaraldehyde. The biocatalysts covalently cross-linked with WZ10-3 lipase by Fe3O4@SiO2-CHO were characterized by FTIR, XRD and TEM. When the enzyme dosage, glutaraldehyde concentration, temperature and time were 30.22 mL, 2.0%, 40 °C and 4 h, the immobilized lipase activity and immobilization rate reached 10038.0 U/g and 96.9%, respectively. The optimum temperatures for immobilized and free lipase were 60 °C and 40 °C. The immobilized enzyme still had 80% enzymatic activity after 48 d storage at 4 °C. The optimized conditions for the direct conversion of immobilized lipase to esterified wet yeast (one-step) were: enzyme dosage 2.5 g, reaction temperature 35 °C; water content 15%; and molar ratio of n-hexane to methanol 3: 1. The transesterification rates of one-step method for oil and biomass were 98.12% and 56.11%, respectively. In contrast, the two-step method was only 88.75% and 51.21%. The immobilized enzyme had 90% enzyme activity after 10 times of reuse. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to develop an energy- and resource-efficient process for the coproduction of edible mushroom, fermentable sugar and solid biofuel from wood residues. A promising potential was revealed for wood ear fungus (Auricularia auricular-judae), which yielded about 200 g mushroom per kg dry birch-based substrate, with concomitant degradation of 76.8 and 85.7% of lignin and xylan, respectively, in the substrate. Substrate pasteurisation by hot-air (85–100 °C) was as effective as by energy intensive autoclaving (121 °C), resulting comparable mushroom growth and degradation of lignocellulose. The spent mushroom substrate (SMS) contained 28–33% glucan, which upon analytical enzymatic saccharification released around 46% of the potentially-achievable glucose, corresponding to a 2.3–fold enzymatic digestibility compared with that of the raw substrate. The solid leftover generated after enzymatic hydrolysis revealed high thermal energy value and promising combustion characteristics, showing a plausibility to be recycled as solid fuel for self-supporting energy system and space heating. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PE-2) behavior in musts of sweet sorghum juice treated with amylolytic enzymes. The experiment was carried out through the 2013/2014 harvest, at 21° 14′ 05"S and 48° 17′ 09′'W. The experimental design was completely randomized with sub-subdivided plots and four replications. The primary treatments were the sweet sorghum genotypes (CV147, CV198 and BRS508); the secondary treatments were the harvest (whole stalks and stalks without leaves and panicles); the tertiary treatments were the two sampling seasons (102 and 116 days after sowing—d.a.s.); and the quaternary treatments were the application of enzymes. The PE-2 yeast was inoculated to initialize the fermentation process; this evaluated the amount of living cells and shoots. The genotype did not affect the cell viability of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PE-2) yeast. Both the clarification process and the application of amylolytic enzymes improved the quality of the must. The harvest season affects the technological quality of the juice causing an effect on fermentation microbiota. © 2020, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

AB  - The need to substitute fossil fuels with energy alternatives has favored the development of biodiesel and green diesel, which generate less amount of particulate matter (PM), but their biological reactivity is unknown, an important factor of quality and risk. Therefore, the genotoxicity and mutagenicity potential of PM emitted by the combustion of mixtures of green diesel and palm biodiesel with petroleum diesel has been evaluated; 10% palm biodiesel (B10), 10% and 30% green diesel (HVO10 and HVO30) and ultralow sulfur diesel (ULSD) were subjected to combustion at two engine operating speeds: 1890 and 2410 rpm. From each PM sample, the organic fraction was extracted to evaluate the mutagenicity with the Ames test in the presence and absence of microsomal enzymes, and the genotoxicity with the alkaline comet assay, while in the Ames test, concentrations of equivalent 3, 1.5, and 0.8 μg of PM/μl were considered; in the comet assay, equivalent 3.1, 6.3, and 12.5 μg of PM/μl were tested. The organic fraction of the PM from the ULSD was the least genotoxic and mutagenic. In contrast, the organic fraction of the PM of HVO30 showed the highest genotoxic and mutagenic activity (p < 0.05). Although the genotoxic potential of PM generated at 1890 rpm, low speed, was slightly higher, no relationship was found regarding the engine operating speed. The results of this investigation show that the fuel extraction method and the mixture with the petroleum diesel affect the quality of the PM and, therefore, its biological activity. Consequently, the physicochemical monitoring of the PM should be complemented with biological procedures to evaluate the quality of alternative fuels and protect the environmental health. © 2020 by ASME.

AB  - Furfurylamine is an important furfural-upgrading biobased chemical for the production of pharmaceuticals, biofuels, fibers, additives, polymers, etc. In one-pot reaction system, biomass was tandemly catalyzed to furfurylamine with aluminium-based alkaline-treated graphite (Al-AG) catalyst and recombinant ω-transaminase biocatalyst. Al-AG (3.6 wt%) catalyzed corncob (75.0 g/L) to 110.0 mM furfural at 56.8% yield (based on xylan in corncob) in γ-valerolactone–water (1:4, v:v; pH 1.0) for 40 min at 180 °C. The pH-adjusted corncob-slurry (pH 7.5) containing furfural were catalyzed to furfurylamine at high yield with γ-valerolactone-tolerant Aspergillus terreus ω-transaminase biocatalyst at 35 °C using isopropylamine (3 mol isopropylamine/mol furfural) as amine donor. Such an efficient and sustainable approach for catalytic conversion of biomass to high-value-added biobased furfurylamine was successfully established in tandem reaction with Al-AG and ω-transaminase biocatalyst.

AB  - Redox mediators are pivotal players in the electron transfer process between enzymes and electrodes. We present an alternative approach for redox mediation based on branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) modified with an osmium complex. This redox polyelectrolyte is crosslinked with phosphate to produce colloidal particles with a diameter of ca. 1 μm, which, combined with glucose oxidase (GOx), can form electroactive assemblies through either layer by layer assembly (LbL) or one-pot drop-casting (OPDC). The addition of NaCl to these colloidal systems induces the formation of films that otherwise poorly grow, presenting an outstanding catalytic current. The system was tested as a bioanode delivering a power output of 148 μW per nmol of mediator. These results are explained in terms of the interactions of the ions with the polyelectrolyte and represent a new route for the development of bioelectrochemical devices involving redox mediators and enzymes.

AB  - One of the key issues in the production of biofuels from agarose is to establish a highly-efficient process for separation of a target product (galactose) and a side-product (levulinic acid) that come from agarose hydrolysis. Regarding this issue, there has been a previous attempt at the separation of galactose (GA) and levulinic acid (LA) using a simulated-moving-bed (SMB) process based on a size-exclusion adsorbent, which, however, had limitations in increasing solute retention capacities and thus hindered a meaningful improvement in the SMB performances. To resolve such problem, we explored an alternative adsorbent that could compensate for the shortcoming of the previously adopted size-exclusion adsorbent. It was found first that an Amberchrom-CG300C resin could adsorb LA strongly while placing GA migration under the control of a size-exclusion mechanism. The resin was thus proposed as the adsorbent for the considered separation. To compare the proposed and the previous adsorbents in terms of the SMB performances for GA–LA separation, the SMB processes based on the two adsorbents were optimized each to maximize throughput and minimize desorbent usage while keeping the product purities above 99%. The resulting Pareto solutions demonstrated that the SMB based on the proposed adsorbent surpassed the SMB based on the previous adsorbent in throughput and desorbent usage by a wide margin. In addition, the replacement of adsorbent from the previous to the proposed one could lead to a significant reduction in the SMB pressure drop. Finally, it was confirmed that the relative superiority of the proposed adsorbent over the previous one in terms of the SMB performances became greater, as the required level of purity or throughput was elevated. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are promising renewable and implantable power sources, but it exhibits low power output due to enzyme structure. The enzyme's catalytic center is deeply buried inside the protein shell, analogous to a polypeptide network, that is thought to be an electron-blocked bioenvironment. Inspired by the fact that alkyl chains can provide a tether binding environment and help porphyrin/Mg complexes transfer photogenerated electrons in photosynthesis in plants, we design enzyme nanocapsules with different alkyl lengths to improve the electron transfer from inside enzyme to the electrode as well as the performance of EBFCs. Three biomimetic cofactor monomers containing different tether binding lengths were synthesized for glucose oxidase (GOx), and the corresponding electroactive GOx nanocapsules [n(GOx)-3, n(GOx)-13, and n(GOx)-21] were constructed via in situ polymerization. Data showed that a relatively longer tether binding length benefited a fast electron transfer, whereas the monomer water solubility also impacted the overall electrochemistry function of GOx nanocapsules and the performance of EBFCs. This study enriches the structure-Activity relationships of monomer as a mediator and may push forward the developments of the high-performance EBFC. ©

AB  - Composting of by-products from the sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) industry can help achieve sustainable biofuel production by replacing mineral fertilizers and adequate residual disposal. The hypothesis was that the compost of filter cake and ash enriched with/without phosphate rocks (apatite-A and phosphorite-P) and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria can replace mineral P fertilizers and improve sugarcane production. A compost was produced from a mixture of filter cake and ash in 60 days of composting. The compost + A and the compost + P (with/without bacteria) were applied at sugarcane planting to supply 150 kg ha−1 P2O5. Yield and quality of sugarcane, soil P dynamics, and enzyme activities in the soil were monitored. Results showed that the application of 20 Mg ha−1 of compost increased sugarcane yield (up to 6%) and β-glucosidase activity (up to 15%) when compared to mineral control. Adding phosphate rock in compost allowed a reduction in the total compost amount from 20 to 10 Mg ha−1, with similar yields. Bacteria inoculation increased sugarcane yield (up to 5%) and acid phosphatase activity (up to 6–18%), enhancing the soil P availability. Compost + P increased labile and moderately labile P contents with a reduction of the acid phosphatase activity. The increase of soluble P (available-P) in the soil is an important gain because most P is fixed (unavailable) in tropical soils. The study revealed a great potential for optimizing by-products generated by the sugarcane industry with the enrichment of compost (adding phosphate rock and phosphate solubilizing bacteria), reducing the dependency of sugarcane production on finite P mineral reserves. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A three-liquid-phase system (TLPS) was developed and used as a novel enzymatic one-pot multistep reaction (EOMR) system. In this system, lipase and phospholipase were enriched in a single liquid phase with a high recovery (ca. 98%) and then used for the simultaneous catalysis of mutually inhibiting and interfering reactions (hydrolysis of phospholipids and glyceride in crude oil). A novel emulsion containing the two dispersed droplets (W2/O/W2 and W1/W2 emulsion structures) could be the key reason for this phenomenon because the emulsion system not only provided a new catalytic interface but also relieved the product inhibition. As a result, the content of free fatty acid (main hydrolysate of the glyceride) and the removal of phospholipid from the crude oil could be increased to 96 and 95%, respectively, within 1 h. The product obtained from the EOMR was directly used in the production of biodiesel via enzymatic esterification, and the content of fatty acid methanol ester could be increased to 93% within 2 h. Furthermore, the enzymes in the middle phase could also be reused, at least for eight rounds without significant loss in catalytic efficiency. Therefore, the TLPS could be considered as an ideal catalytic platform for the EOMR. ©

AB  - Carbon microelectromechanical system (C-MEMS) and carbon nanoelectromechanical system (C-NEMS) have been identified as promising technologies for a range of biotech applications, including electrochemical biosensors, biofuel cells, neural probes, and dielectrophoretic cell trapping. Research teams around the world have devoted more and more time to this field. After almost two decades of efforts on developing C-MEMS and C-NEMS, a review of the relevant progress and addressing future research opportunities and critical issues is in order. This review first introduces C-MEMS and C-NEMS fabrication processes that fall into two categories: photolithography- and non-photolithography- based techniques. Next, a detailed discussion of the state of the art, and technical challenges and opportunities associated with C-MEMS and C-NEMS devices used in biotech applications are presented. These devices are discussed in the relevant sub-sections of biosensors, biofuel cells, intracorporeal neural probe, dielectrophoresis cell trapping, and cell culture. The review concludes with an exposition of future perspectives in C-MEMS and C-NEMS. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new process for the production of bioethanol from paper mill sludge (PMS) is described in this work. PMS biomass feedstock was processed via the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with and without accelerants. The enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation were first evaluated, and the energy demand was 2.2 MJ/L of produced ethanol. When the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation were combined, the energy demand was reduced to 1.0 MJ/L ethanol, the sugars production increased, and the overall capital cost of the process decreased. The sugar yield was improved by adding accelerant and selecting the optimal fiber recovery method. The accelerant improved the enzymatic hydrolysis via a pathing/bridging mechanism. The SSF with the chemical fiber recovery method coupled with accelerant addition would be the best process configuration. Upon this combination, the glucose profile was enhanced from 9.8 g/L to 17.0 g/L. The sludge fiber conversion by SSF was improved by selecting an efficient fiber recovery method combined with the accelerant addition. SSF in chemical fiber recovery with accelerant addition was the best process by a 10% improvement of ethanol yield. The proposed process configuration offers a lower cost and sustainable process and contributes to the circular economy of zero waste discharges. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, a multiperiod, multiobjective, and multiproduct second-generation biodiesel supply chain network is innovated, taking into account sustainable development and international resources and demand. The proposed model maximizes the total profit and positive social issues and minimizes the harmful environmental consequences of the network. Furthermore, as trade is nowadays considered to be an important issue on an international scale, economic globalization is also considered in the present study by expanding the operational activities of supplying feedstocks and selling final products worldwide. The model is validated through real data collected within Iran and some Asian countries and solved by the interactive fuzzy programming method. The experimental results verify the efficiency of the model for countries that have the capacity to produce inedible-based biofuel. As a result, the highest share of the revenues is earmarked for international biodiesel sales (80%), which indicates that globalization can increase the profit to a great extent. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Due to high levels of volatility in both the agricultural and the forestry commodity markets, specifically, of timber and agricultural crops, it is important to identify the risks associated with the stability of supplies necessary for the production of composite materials in the Czech Republic. This study aims to accurately estimate the availability of selected raw materials that contain lignocellulose over the next 20 years. In addition, their suitability for the production of composite materials is assessed based on their physical properties. Furthermore, in the event of scarcity involving timber in the European Union, recycled wood and post-harvest residues could replace conventional raw materials in wood-based composites such as particleboards and chipboards. The viable potential of Czech forests is predicted to be between 740 and 750 million cubic meters of timber. For agricultural crops, it is estimated at 0.9 million hectares of wheat and 0.5 million hectares of canola under the current EU biofuel policy and at 0.4 million hectares if this policy is removed. According to moisture and fibre analyses carried out in our study, the most suitable candidate for wood-based composites production is soft wood. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Fast-growing poplar trees from plantations are the source of inexpensive wood that is intended mainly for chemical processing in the pulp and paper industry. Their potential as raw material for biofuel manufacturing is widely discussed as well. The detailed chemical composition of this raw material is therefore an important question. Five species of poplars were investigated: Populus alba, P. maximowiczii, P. trichocarpa, P. nigra, and P. tremula. Wood is a material consisting mainly of lignocellulose, but there are also many extractives. In temperate zone climate they typ-ically represent up to 5% of wood mass. Their identification is difficult, due to various classes of compounds and great number of individual ones. These compounds can affect the properties of wood—its resistance to biotic agents and suitability to enzymatic treatment towards biofuels. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer (GC-MS) was used to analysis of extractives in various species of poplar wood. Compounds from several classes were identified like phenols, fatty acids, and their derivatives, sterols. Their identification was discussed along with estimation of their content in wood of investigated species. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The efficacy of C4 grasses as feedstocks for liquid fuel production and their climate mitigation potential remain unresolved in the tropics. To identify highly convertible C4 grasses, we measured final fuels and postprocess biomass produced in two laboratory-scale conversion pathways across 12 species and varieties within the Poaceae (grass) family. Total mass, carbon, and energy in final fuels and postprocess biomass were assessed based on field mass and area-based production. Two lignocellulosic processes were investigated: (1) anaerobic digestion (AD) to methane and (2) hot water pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis (HWP-EH) to ethanol. We found AD converted lignocellulose to methane more efficiently in terms of carbon and energy compared to ethanol production using HWP-EH, although improvements to and the optimization of each process could change these contrasts. The resulting data provide design limitations for agricultural production and biorefinery systems that regulate these systems as net carbon sources or sinks to the atmosphere. Median carbon recovery in final fuels and postprocess biomass from the studied C4 grasses were ~5 Mg C ha−1 year−1 for both methane and ethanol, while median energy recovery was ~200 MJ ha−1 year−1 for ethanol and ~275 MJ ha−1 year−1 for methane. The highest carbon and energy recovery from lignocellulose was achieved during methane production from a sugarcane hybrid called energycane, with ~10 Mg C ha−1 year−1 and ~450 MJ ha−1 year−1 of carbon and energy recovered, respectively, from fuels and post-process biomass combined. Carbon and energy recovery during ethanol production was also highest for energycane, with ~9 Mg C ha−1 year−1 and ~350 MJ ha−1 year−1 of carbon and energy recovered in fuels and postprocess biomass combined. Although several process streams remain unresolved, agricultural production and conversion of C4 grasses must operate within these carbon and energy limitations for biofuel and bioenergy production to be an atmospheric carbon sink. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The versatile compound n-butanol is one of the most promising biofuels for use in existing internal combustion engines, contributing to a smooth transition towards a clean energy society. Furthermore, n-butanol is a valuable resource to produce more complex molecules such as bioplastics. Microbial production of n-butanol from waste materials is hampered by the biotoxicity of n-butanol as it interferes with the proper functioning of lipid membranes. In this study we perform a largescale investigation of the complete lipid-related enzyme machinery and its response to exposure to a sublethal concentration of n-butanol. We profiled, in triplicate, the growth characteristics and phospholipidomes of 116 different genetic constructs of E. coli, both in the presence and absence of 0.5% n-butanol (v/v). This led to the identification of 230 lipid species and subsequently to the reconstruction of the network of metabolites, enzymes and lipid properties driving the homeostasis of the E. coli lipidome. We were able to identify key lipids and biochemical pathways leading to altered n-butanol tolerance. The data led to new conceptual insights into the bacterial lipid metabolism which are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Second-generation biofuel production is in high demand, but lignocellulosic biomass’ complexity impairs its use due to the vast diversity of enzymes necessary to execute the complete saccharification. In nature, lignocellulose can be rapidly deconstructed due to the division of biochemical labor effectuated in bacterial communities. Here, we analyzed the lignocellulolytic potential of a bacterial consortium obtained from soil and dry straw leftover from a sugarcane milling plant. This consortium was cultivated for 20 weeks in aerobic conditions using sugarcane bagasse as a sole carbon source. Scanning electron microscopy and chemical analyses registered modification of the sugarcane fiber’s appearance and biochemical composition, indicating that this consortium can deconstruct cellulose and hemicellulose but no lignin. A total of 52 metagenome-assembled genomes from eight bacterial classes (Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, Cytophagia, Gammaproteobacteria, Oligoflexia, and Thermoleophilia) were recovered from the consortium, in which ~46% of species showed no relevant modification in their abundance during the 20 weeks of cultivation, suggesting a mostly stable consortium. Their CAZymes repertoire indicated that many of the most abundant species are known to deconstruct lignin (e.g., Chryseobacterium) and carry sequences related to hemicellulose and cellulose deconstruction (e.g., Chitinophaga, Niastella, Niabella, and Siphonobacter). Taken together, our results unraveled the bacterial diversity, enzymatic potential, and effectiveness of this lignocellulose-decomposing bacterial consortium. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Ulmus pumila L. is an excellent afforestation and biofuel tree that produces high-quality wood, rich in starch. In addition, U. pumila is highly adaptable to adverse environmental conditions, which is conducive to its utilization for vegetating saline soils. However, little is known about the physiological responses and transcriptional regulatory network of U. pumila under salt stress. In this study, we exposed five main cultivars in saline–alkali land (Upu2, 5, 8, 11, and 12) to NaCl stress. Of the five cultivars assessed, Upu11 exhibited the highest salt resistance. Growth and biomass accumulation in Upu11 were promoted under low salt concentrations (<150 mM). However, after 3 months of continuous treatment with 150 mM NaCl, growth was inhibited, and photosynthesis declined. A transcriptome analysis conducted after 3 months of treatment detected 7009 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs). The gene annotation indicated that these DEGs were mainly related to photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Furthermore, PHOTOSYNTHETIC ELECTRON TRANSFERH (UpPETH), an important electron transporter in the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and UpWAXY, a key gene controlling amylose synthesis in the starch synthesis pathway, were identified as hub genes in the gene coexpression network. We identified 25 and 62 unigenes that may interact with PETH and WAXY, respectively. Overexpression of UpPETH and UpWAXY significantly increased the survival rates, net photosynthetic rates, biomass, and starch content of transgenic Arabidopsis plants under salt stress. Our findings clarify the physiological and transcriptional regulators that promote or inhibit growth under environmental stress. The identification of salt-responsive hub genes directly responsible for photosynthesis and starch synthesis or metabolism will provide targets for future genetic improvements. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The native ability of Clostridium thermocellum to efficiently solubilize cellulose makes it an interesting platform for sustainable biofuel production through consolidated bioprocessing. Together with other improvements, industrial implementation of C. thermocellum, as well as fundamental studies into its metabolism, would benefit from improved and reproducible consumption of hexose sugars. To investigate growth of C. thermocellum on glucose or fructose, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, laboratory evolution was performed in carbon-limited chemostats with increasing concentrations of glucose or fructose and decreasing cellobiose concentrations. Growth on both glucose and fructose was achieved with biomass yields of 0.09 ± 0.00 and 0.18 ± 0.00 gbiomassgsubstrate—1, respectively, compared to 0.15 ± 0.01 gbiomassgsubstrate—1for wild type on cellobiose. Single-colony isolates had no or short lag times on the monosaccharides, while wild type showed 42 ± 4 h on glucose and &gt;80 h on fructose. With good growth on glucose, fructose, and cellobiose, the fructose isolates were chosen for genome sequence-based reverse metabolic engineering. Deletion of a putative transcriptional regulator (Clo1313_1831), which upregulated fructokinase activity, reduced lag time on fructose to 12 h with a growth rate of 0.11 ± 0.01 h—1and resulted in immediate growth on glucose at 0.24 ± 0.01 h—1. Additional introduction of a G-to-V mutation at position 148 in cbpA resulted in immediate growth on fructose at 0.32 ± 0.03 h—1. These insights can guide engineering of strains for fundamental studies into transport and the upper glycolysis, as well as maximizing product yields in industrial settings. Importance C. thermocellum is an important candidate for sustainable and costeffective production of bioethanol through consolidated bioprocessing. In addition to unsurpassed cellulose deconstruction, industrial application and fundamental studies would benefit from improvement of glucose and fructose consumption. This study demonstrated that C. thermocellum can be evolved for reproducible constitutive growth on glucose or fructose. Subsequent genome sequencing, gene editing, and physiological characterization identified two underlying mutations with a role in (regulation of) transport or metabolism of the hexose sugars. In light of these findings, such mutations have likely (and unknowingly) also occurred in previous studies with C. thermocellum using hexose-based media with possible broad regulatory consequences. By targeted modification of these genes, industrial and research strains of C. thermocellum can be engineered to (i) reduce glucose accumulation, (ii) study cellodextrin transport systems in vivo, (iii) allow experiments at &gt;120 g liter—1soluble substrate concentration, or (iv) reduce costs for labeling studies.

AB  - Extracellular and cell-bound lipase-producing yeasts were isolated from the palm oil mill wastes and investigated for their potential uses as biocatalysts in biodiesel production. Twenty-six yeast strains were qualitatively screened as lipase producers. From those yeast strains, only six were selected and screened further for quantitative lipase production.The phylogenetic affiliations of the yeast strains were confirmed by investigating the D1/D2 domains of 26S rDNA and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 molecular regions of the six yeast strains selected as potent lipase producers. The three yeast strains A4C, 18B, and 10F showed a close association with Magnusiomyces capitatus. Two yeast strains (17B and AgB) had a close relationship with Saprochaete clavata, whereas the strain AW2 was identified as Magnusiomyces spicifer. Three main catalytic activities of the yeast lipases were evaluated and Magnusiomyces capitatus A4C, among the selected lipase-producing yeasts, had the highest extracellular lipolytic enzyme activity (969 U/L) with the cell-bound lipolytic enzyme activity of 11.3 U/gdm. The maximum cell-bound lipolytic activity (12.4 U/gdm) was observed in the cell-bound lipase fraction produced by Magnusiomyces spicifer AW2 with an extracellular lipolytic enzyme activity of 886 U/L. Based on the specific hydrolytic enzymatic activities, the cell-bound lipases (CBLs) from the three yeast strains M. capitatus A4C, M. spicifer AW2, and Saprochaete clavata 17B were further investigated for biodiesel production. Among them, the CBL from M. spicifer AW2 synthesized the most FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) at 81.2% within 12 h indicating that it has potential for application in enzymatic biodiesel production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Torrefaction pretreatment can upgrade biomass by reducing its oxygen content. In this study, torrefaction pretreatments with different severities (200 °C, 230 °C, 260 °C, and 290 °C) were employed to study their effects on the pyrolysis behaviors and kinetics of cellulose. Results showed that pretreatment at 290 °C was highly effective for oxygen removal. Among the torrefied samples, the solid product of cellulose torrefied at 290 °C had the lowest mass yield of 81.80%, lowest energy yield of 89.60%, highest carbon content of 44.91%, and highest HHV of 16.67 MJ kg−1. Pyrolysis activation energy of torrefied cellulose changed slightly at 200–260 °C, but increased significantly at 290 °C. According to XRD results, at the torrefaction temperature of 290 °C, the crystal structure of cellulose changed significantly. The results of Py-GC/MS showed that the relative contents of anhydrosugars in the bio-oil were decreased by torrefaction pretreatment. The high temperature at 290 °C has the most significant effect on the performance of bio-oil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Key message: A transcriptome analysis reveals the transcripts and alleles differentially expressed in sugarcane genotypes with contrasting lignin composition. Abstract: Sugarcane bagasse is a highly abundant resource that may be used as a feedstock for the production of biofuels and bioproducts in order to meet increasing demands for renewable replacements for fossil carbon. However, lignin imparts rigidity to the cell wall that impedes the efficient breakdown of the biomass into fermentable sugars. Altering the ratio of the lignin units, syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G), which comprise the native lignin polymer in sugarcane, may facilitate the processing of bagasse. This study aimed to identify genes and markers associated with S/G ratio in order to accelerate the development of sugarcane bioenergy varieties with modified lignin composition. The transcriptome sequences of 12 sugarcane genotypes that contrasted for S/G ratio were compared and there were 2019 transcripts identified as differentially expressed (DE) between the high and low S/G ratio groups. These included transcripts encoding possible monolignol biosynthetic pathway enzymes, transporters, dirigent proteins and transcriptional and post-translational regulators. Furthermore, the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared between the low and high S/G ratio groups to identify specific alleles expressed with the phenotype. There were 2063 SNP loci across 787 unique transcripts that showed group-specific expression. Overall, the DE transcripts and SNP alleles identified in this study may be valuable for breeding sugarcane varieties with altered S/G ratio that may provide desirable bioenergy traits. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In this work, a novel glucose quantification strategy is presented in a self-powered biosensing device. The analyte in the sample is oxidized in an enzymatic fuel cell and the generated charge is transferred to a capacitor. The built-up capacitor voltage at a specific time can be directly correlated with the concentration of analyte. An electro-fluidic switch placed on a paper-based microfluidic channel connects a minimalistic electronic circuit to the fuel cell. The circuit modules discriminate the built-up capacitor voltage, which corresponds to a particular glucose range. The digital semi-quantitative result is visualized vía electrochromic displays. As a practical application of this working principle, the self-powered single-use device has been designed to perform screening of gestational diabetes mellitus. The device discriminates between healthy (<7.8 mm), pre-diabetes (>7.8 mm), and diabetes (>11.1 mm) condition providing a reliable result. This single use, printable, and disposable self-powered glucose biosensing device is autonomous and fully powered by the glucose contained in a 3.5 µL sample. It offers an energy-saving, environmentally friendly, and low-cost solution for Point-of-Care testing. By replacing the selective enzyme in the fuel cell, this strategy can be used for measuring other health parameters such as creatinine, cholesterol, or uric acid, among others. © 2021 National Microelectronics Center.

AB  - Acetyl-triacylglycerols (acetyl-TAG) contain an acetate group in the sn-3 position instead of the long-chain fatty acid present in regular triacylglycerol (TAG). The acetate group confers unique physical properties such as reduced viscosity and a lower freezing point to acetyl-TAG, providing advantages for use as emulsifiers, lubricants, and ‘drop-in’ biofuels. Previously, the synthesis of acetyl-TAG in the seeds of the oilseed crop camelina (Camelina sativa) was achieved through the heterologous expression of the diacylglycerol acetyltransferase gene EaDAcT, isolated from Euonymus alatus seeds that naturally accumulate high levels of acetyl-TAG. Subsequent work identified a similar acetyltransferase, EfDAcT, in the seeds of Euonymus fortunei, that possesses higher in vitro activity compared to EaDAcT. In this study, the seed-specific expression of EfDAcT in camelina led to a 20 mol% increase in acetyl-TAG levels over that of EaDAcT. Coupling EfDAcT expression with suppression of the endogenous competing enzyme DGAT1 further enhanced acetyl-TAG accumulation, up to 90 mol% in the best transgenic lines. Accumulation of high levels of acetyl-TAG was stable over multiple generations, with minimal effect on seed size, weight, and fatty acid content. Slight delays in germination were noted in transgenic seeds compared to the wild type. EfDAcT transcript and protein levels were correlated during seed development with a limited window of EfDAcT protein accumulation. In high acetyl-TAG producing lines, EfDAcT protein expression in developing seeds did not reflect the eventual acetyl-TAG levels in mature seeds, suggesting that other factors limit acetyl-TAG accumulation. © 2021 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The economic viability of current bio-production systems is often limited by its low productivity due to slow cell growth and low substrate uptake rate. The fastest-growing bacterium Vibrio natriegens is a highly promising next-generation workhorse of the biotechnology industry which can utilize various industrially relevant carbon sources with high substrate uptake rates. Here, we demonstrate the first systematic engineering example of V. natriegens for the heterologous production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) from glycerol. Systems metabolic engineering strategies have been applied in this study to develop a superior 1,3-PDO producer, including: (1) heterologous pathway construction and optimization; (2) engineering cellular transcriptional regulators and global transcriptomic analysis; (3) enhancing intracellular reducing power by cofactor engineering; (4) reducing the accumulation of toxic intermediate by pathway engineering; (5) systematic engineering of glycerol oxidation pathway to eliminate byproduct formation. A final engineered strain can efficiently produce 1,3-PDO with a titer of 56.2 g/L, a yield of 0.61 mol/mol, and an average productivity of 2.36 g/L/h. The strategies described in this study would be useful for engineering V. natriegens as a potential chassis for the production of other useful chemicals and biofuels. © 2021 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - The development of a culture medium is an essential step in any bioprocess involving microorganisms for the bioconversion of by-products to valuable chemicals, making industries like the biofuel industry more competitive. Optimization of the bioconversion process to minimize cost while maximizing yield underscores the importance of using computational methods to identify cellular requirements under specific growth conditions. In this study, a computational approach was proposed as an alternative to optimizing glycerol consumption in one of the most common production chassis, Escherichia coli, specifically strain ATCC 8739. Nineteen compounds were identified as essential for E. coli growth in glycerol. Of these, three reactions associated with nitrogen, phosphorous, and oxygen availability were determined as crucial to reaching high growth and glycerol uptake rates. Based on computational results, a glycerol-based medium was supplemented with reported common chemical compounds that contain nitrogen or phosphorous (NH4Cl, Na2HPO4, and K2HPO4) for further experimental validation. When comparing the supplemented culture medium experimentally with LB medium (Luria Bertani), a two-fold increment in the glycerol consumption was observed. Transcriptomic analysis of the most promising culture medium reveals that high glycerol utilization under aerobic conditions is dependent on phosphorus to avoid toxicity within the cell because of glycerol-3-phosphate generation. The result of this study is a resource to determine nutritional requirements that allow the improvement of the use of raw material for the production of compounds that are attractive to the bio-based industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the interactions between banana pseudo-stems (BPS) and chicken manure (CM) during anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) in batch and semi-continuous experiments. The batch experiments results showed that the methane yield was the highest (193.7 mL/g VS) in AcoD with BPS: CM ratio of 4:1, which was increased by 57.2% and 66.1%, respectively. Semi-continuous experiments revealed that AcoD resulted in higher methane production. Monitoring of the system parameters indicated that AcoD could better adapt to the increasing organic loading rate, with better system stability and methane production efficiency. The microbial analysis illustrated that AcoD increased the relative abundance of hydrolytic bacteria such as Firmicutes, Patescibacteria, and Bacteroidetes. With regard to archaea, AcoD improved the abundance of Methanosaeta, the major acetoclastic methanogens. These changes in the microbial flora allowed AcoD to remain stable while efficiently producing methane and improved the BPS and CM processing efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The physicochemical properties of dried distiller's grains (DDGs) were measured and the pyrolysis kinetics analysis was experimentally investigated by the non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at four heating rates of 10, 20, 30 and 40 K min−1. The results of proximate and elemental analysis showed that DDGs contained relatively high contents of volatile organic components (VOCs, 89.4 wt.%) and carbon (47.0 wt.%), and a higher value of heat content (20.4 MJ kg−1), compared with some other typical agricultural residues feedstocks. The pyrolysis kinetics of DDGs sample were analyzed using the Friedman isoconversional method. The obtained effective activation energies vary with the degree of conversion: 151.2-176.3 kJ mol−1 (α: 0.05−0.10, T: 383–506 K), 176.3-206.4 kJ mol−1 (α: 0.10−0.60, T: 506–653 K), 206.4-320.5 kJ mol−1 (α: 0.60−0.95, T: &gt; 653 K), which correspond to the thermal decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose and part of lignin, and remaining lignin. And the decomposition temperatures of DDGs components shift to lower temperature, compared with those of typical lignocellulosic biomass, which is caused by the presence of high activity degraded enzymes during brewing process. The physicochemical properties and pyrolysis kinetic results have shown that DDGs has great thermochemical conversion potential for bioenergy. We anticipate these findings will contribute to the industrial application of DDGs pyrolysis to produce biofuel or high-value chemicals and materials. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The advent of policies that incentivize or require alternative diesel fuels has increased the demand for the development of fast analytical methods aiming for the quality control of these fuels. This study approached an alternative method for the determination of biodiesel acidity employing capillary zone electrophoresis based on free fatty acids screening and quantification. Sample preparation comprised vortex-assisted liquid-liquid extraction of free fatty acids and was a crucial step for analysis. It was studied through a 32 full factorial design considering sample mass and the stirring time. Then, solvent suitability was evaluated univariately. The free fatty acid screening was carried out employing a capillary zone electrophoresis method able to separate C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 n-9, C18:2 n-6, and C18:3 n-3, major fatty acids in a variety of vegetable oils used for biodiesel synthesis. In addition to the straightforward sample preparation protocol, the running time of the developed method was only 12 min. Moreover, ultraviolet absorption indirect detection of analytes was approached to avoid analytes derivatization, considering the lack of chromophore groups in saturated fatty acids. Statistical tests did not evidence any significant differences in the biodiesel acidity determination expressed in percentage of free fatty acids when comparing the proposed capillary zone electrophoresis method and the traditional potentiometric titration approach within the 95% confidence interval, which demonstrates the suitability of this alternative method for the biodiesel quality control in routine. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - An enzymatic biofuel cell cathode was elaborated by nano-structuration and functionalization of graphite using two consecutive plasma treatments before immobilization of laccase as a biocatalyst to perform oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by direct electron transfer ((DET). Nano-structuration of graphite surfaces by synthesis of vertical graphen-like carbon nanowalls (CNWs) was performed by microwave excited plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) system was then used to functionalize chemically the CNWs surface via a rapid and dry route. A partial fractional design evidenced two significant parameters of the APPJ treatment in terms of ORR current density: the treatment time and the inter-distance between the plasma jet and the surface of the carbon material. With the optimized APPJ treatment parameters, a four-fold enhancement of the ORR current density (-440 ± 70 µA/cm2) could be obtained on CNWs, compared to graphite electrodes. The best current density obtained was about −1 mA/cm2 with oxidized laccase covalently immobilized on the electrode without any agitation of the solution, confirming the main importance of enzyme orientation on the electrode surface for efficient DET transfer, the relevance of electrode nanostructuration and the advantage of covalent linking of the protein on the electrode surface. © 2021

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitrosomonas eutropha is a chemolithoautotrophic organism with an ability to oxidize ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. Continuous culture with and without cell recycling was used to enhance production of N. eutropha cell biomass using a 40-L bioreactor. Whole cell biotransformation was used to convert methane (CH4) present in the biogas into biomethanol using N. eutropha. RESULTS: The maximum biomass production rate of N. eutropha was increased by three-fold with provision of cell recycling in the continuous culture. Removal of nitrite from the continuous culture resulted in high activity of ammonia monooxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of CH4 to biomethanol. Use of ammonium sulfate as a source of electrons for biotransformation reaction with N. eutropha resulted in a maximum 119.86 mg L−1 of biomethanol production. CONCLUSION: Our research provides an efficient process for biomass production of N. eutropha using continuous culture. We have demonstrated improvement in CH4 to biomethanol conversion using biogas as feedstock. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Designing an artificial enzyme, from the perspective of bionics, to mimic the catalytic activity of natural enzymes is highly desirable but remains challenges. In response to the simulation of biological structure, we developed cytochrome c oxidase (CcO)-like single-atom nanozymes with FeN5 active centers (FeN5 SAs) in this work. Similar to the spatial structure of heme a3 in natural CcO, the active center of FeN5 SAs is axial N-coordinated heme-like structure and can be served as oxygen-binding site to complete oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in respiratory electron transport chain by catalyzing the oxidation of cytochrome c (Cyt c). Depending on this bionic structure, furthermore, FeN5 SAs exhibited competitive electrocatalytic performance towards ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.67 V (vs. RHE) at neutral condition. Coupling a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) bioanode, the FeN5 SAs-based glucose/O2 enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) obtained a maximum power density of 149.2 ± 4.0 μW cm−2 with an open circuit potential of 0.40 ± 0.01 V. In this study, inspired by the native structure of enzymes, we develop CcO-like FeN5 SAs and expand its application in EBFCs, which may provide an rational research approach to advance the development of nanozymes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is an innovative technology, which can yield valuable organic chemicals with concomitant CO2 sequestration by employing microbes as biocatalysts. The mode of operation has an imperative role in the performance of MES, thus, affecting the yield of synthesized organic chemicals from the MES. However, to the best of our knowledge, the optimal mode of operation for MES has not been determined till date. Hence, in the present investigation, two MES were operated: one in batch mode (MES-B) and another in continuous mode (MES-C), and their performance was monitored. The MES-B exhibited 31%, 33.5% and 44% higher production rate of acetate, propionate and butyrate, respectively, in comparison to MES-C. Moreover, the performance of MES-B also stabilized faster, and microbiome in the cathodic chamber of MES-B was able to accept 26% more electrons supplied to it externally, which were employed as reducing equivalents to reduce CO2. The enactment of MES-B was superior to that of MES-C due to the higher retention of CO2 and hydrogen in cathodic chamber of MES-B. Therefore, operating MES in batch mode would aid in yielding more organic chemicals through CO2 sequestration.

AB  - The subject of this study was to upgrade the pyrolysis bio-oil by torrefaction combined with different order of acid washing. The pyrolysis behavior of biochar obtained from different pretreatments were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and fixed furnace. Moreover, the composition of bio-oil was systematically analyzed by GC-MS. The results showed that torrefaction promoted the aggregation of phenols in bio-oil through removing the hemicellulose and part of cellulose. In addition, aldehydes had increased significantly after acid washing. The acid washing combined with torrefaction could reduce the formation of acids, alcohols and other organic substances except for phenols, aldehydes and ketones. Compared with the pyrolysis bio-oil obtained by directly torrefaction pretreatment, the absolute content of phenols in the pyrolysis bio-oil was slightly reduced from 74 mg/gRH to 63 mg/gRH after first inorganic acid washing and then torrefaction, while the absolute content of furfural increased from 2.8 mg/gRH to 16 mg/gRH. The mechanism showed that the furfural was selected by the catalysis of acid and the torrefaction promoted the cellulose to convert to 1-hydroxy-2-propanone by cracking reaction. This study provided a simple and practical method for the selective production of furfural and phenol from rice husk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focused on the development of an efficient technology for bioconversion of cassava to bioethanol without high temperature digesting. Mechanical activation (MA, ball milling)-metal salt (MA-MS) technology was applied to pretreat cassava flour, leading to significant changes in crystal structure, morphology, and viscosity. The destruction of stable structure of cassava flour induced by MA-MS pretreatment increased the accessibility of glucoamylase to starch granules from surface to interior, which contributed to direct and efficient saccharification of cassava flour without digesting. The decrease in viscosity of slurry and the use of metal salt as nutrient for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) had favorable effect on fermentation process. The combination of MA and MgSO4 exhibited outstanding synergistic interaction. The ethanol concentration and conversion efficiency of MA-MgSO4 pretreated cassava flour achieved 13.64 vol% and 93.4% under optimum conditions (addition amount of MgSO4 = 6 wt%, MA time = 75 min, dosage of glucoamylase = 200 U/g cassava, and dosage of Saccharomyces cerevisiae = 0.3 wt%). MA-MS pretreatment significantly enhanced the saccharification and fermentation processes for efficient bioconversion of cassava to bioethanol by non-digesting strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Production of biobased chemicals from renewable resources is a green starring approach that serves as a substitute to petroleum derivatives. Bioglycerol, with its growing production as a co-product of biodiesel, is an attractive low-cost feedstock for the synthesis of platform chemicals by microbial fermentation. 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) is amongst the top biorefinery platform chemicals that can be produced by glycerol fermentation. RESULTS: The ‘Circular Economy’ concept is demonstrated by converting the by-product bioglycerol using a cell-free extract of Enterobacter aerogenes NCIM 2695 (National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms, NCIM), yielding 22 g L−1 2,3-BDO, in 96 h, 98% atom economy and 0.4 g/g E factor. The cell-free bioglycerol conversion to 2,3-BDO was proved using a modified procedure for determining glycerol dehydrogenase enzyme assay by protein analysis and it was also shown to be cell-bounded. CONCLUSION: Our study offers an effective utilization of the leftover material (i.e. cell-free extract) that biocatalysed C3 to C4 diol, which adds value to the overall economics of the process using only crude glycerol (C3) itself as a fermentative medium. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - BACKGROUND: 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) is one of the important platform chemicals used for biofuels and biochemicals. To make an economically feasible production of 2,3-BD, an optimization process with a cheap substrate is required. The best conditions for enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation were investigated to achieve high concentration and yield of 2,3-BD from cassava starch while reducing the production cost regarding enzyme usage, energy input and medium preparation. RESULTS: A 2.5 L bioreactor containing 1 L working volume of sterilized and gelatinized starch (130 g L−1) was placed at room temperature (25 °C). When the temperature of the starch solution reached 85 °C, α-amylase (200 U g−1 starch) was added to the solution. The enzymatic reaction was allowed to proceed while the temperature of the solution was simultaneously dampened to 45 °C within 1 h. The reaction was further maintained at 45 °C for another 2 h. After hydrolysis, 64.8 g L−1 2,3-BD was produced with a yield of 0.46 g g−1, productivity of 1.25 g L−1 h−1 and few by-products by Klebsiella oxytoca KMS006. Further improvements of 2,3-BD (92.5 g L−1) and yield (0.49 g g−1) were observed in fed-batch mode under a constant feeding rate of 3.5 g starch h−1. CONCLUSION: With our developed strategy, costs related to energy consumption and medium preparation were reduced by using heat generated by autoclave as well as by neglecting the use of glucoamylase for hydrolysis of cassava starch. The highest yield of 2,3-BD (0.49 g g−1) was achieved, which is 98% of theoretical maximum. The process may be applied to the economical production of 2,3-BD. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Efficient biological conversion of all sugars from lignocellulosic biomass is necessary for the cost-effective production of biofuels and commodity chemicals. Galactose is one of the most abundant sugar in many hemicelluloses, and it will be important to capture this carbon for an efficient bioconversion process of plant biomass. Thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila has been used as a cell factory to produce biochemicals directly from renewable polysaccharides. In this study, we draw out the two native galactose utilization pathways, including the Leloir pathway and oxido-reductive pathway, and identify the significance and contribution of them, through transcriptional profiling analysis of M. thermophila and its mutants on galactose. We find that galactokinase was necessary for galactose transporter expression, and disruption of galK resulted in decreased galactose utilization. Through metabolic engineering, both galactokinase deletion and galactose transporter overexpression can activate internal the oxido-reductive pathway and improve the consumption rate of galactose. Finally, the heterologous galactose-degradation pathway, De Ley–Doudoroff (DLD) pathway, was successfully integrated into M. thermophila, and the consumption rate of galactose in the engineered strain was increased by 57%. Our study focuses on metabolic engineering for accelerating galactose utilization in a thermophilic fungus that will be beneficial for the rational design of fungal strains to produce biofuels and biochemicals from a variety of feedstocks with abundant galactose. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Sun, Zhao, Gu, Liu, Wu, Wang, Tian and Li.

AB  - Carbonaceous materials are promising electrode materials for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) due to their excellent electrical conductivity, chemical and physical stability and biocompatibility. Design and preparation of carbon materials with a hollow structure and a rough surface are of great significance for immobilization of enzymes both inside and outside the carbon materials for EBFC applications. We report herein the synthesis of novel carbonaceous materials consisting of bamboo-shaped hollow N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and C3N4 nanosheets (denoted as N-CNTs@C3N4) as electrode materials for dual-capture of enzymes in glucose/O2 EBFCs. The combination of one-dimensional N-CNTs with an open structure and two-dimensional C3N4 nanosheets forms a three-dimensional crosslinking network that significantly enhances the immobilization of enzymes, electrode stability, and mass transfer of substrates, thus boosting the EBFC performance. As a result, EBFCs equipped with N-CNTs@C3N4 can generate a high open circuit potential of 0.93 V and output a maximum power density of 0.57 mW cm-2 at 0.47 V. Additionally, the as-fabricated glucose/O2 EBFCs are capable of directly harvesting energy from various soft drinks, which indicates the promising applications of the N-CNTs@C3N4 nanocomposite as an electrode material for EBFCs. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Exploiting suitable oxidation catalysts is of great importance in the development of sugar-based fuel cells (SFCs). Herein, a novel room-temperature glucose/O2fuel cell (GFC), which employs 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (ACT) as an anodic electrocatalyst and air-breathing Pt-C as a cathode, is demonstrated. Under room temperature operation, the as-assembled GFCs are capable of delivering a maximum power density of 100 μW cm−2in the presence of 50 mM glucose. Bulk electrolysis products of glucose identified by mass spectrum and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy include gluconic acid and glucaric acid, suggesting that the aldehyde and primary hydroxy groups of glucose can be deeply oxidized into carboxyl groups through a 6e−pathway. The deep glucose oxidation capability makes ACT a promising anodic electrocatalyst for SFCs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Enzyme stability and activity at elevated temperatures are important aspects in biotechnological industries, such as the conversion of plant biomass into biofuels. In order to reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of biomass conversion, better enzymatic processing must be developed. Hot springs represent a treasure trove of underexplored microbiological and protein chemistry diversity. Herein, we conduct an exploratory study into the diversity of hot spring biomass-degrading potential. We describe the taxonomic diversity and carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) coding potential in 71 publicly available metagenomic datasets from 58 globally distributed terrestrial geothermal features. Through taxonomic profiling, we detected a wide diversity of microbes unique to varying temperature and pH ranges. Biomass-degrading enzyme potential included all five classes of CAZymes and we described the presence or absence of genes encoding 19 glycosyl hydrolases hypothesized to be involved with cellulose, hemicellulose, and oligosaccharide degradation. Our results highlight hot springs as a promising system for the further discovery and development of thermo-stable biomass-degrading enzymes that can be applied toward generation of renewable biofuels. This study lays a foundation for future research to further investigate the functional diversity of hot spring biomass-degrading enzymes and their potential utility in biotechnological processing. © Copyright © 2021 Reichart, Bowers, Woyke and Hatzenpichler.

AB  - Energy supply limits development through fuel constraints and climatic effects. Production of renewable energy is a central pillar of sustainability but will need to play an increasingly important role in energy generation in order to mitigate fossil-fuel based greenhouse-gas emissions. Global freshwaters represent a vast reservoir of biomass and biogenic CH4. Here we demonstrate the great potential for the optimized use of this nonfossil carbon as a source of energy that is replenishable within a human lifetime. The feasibility of up-scaled adsorption-driven technologies to capture and refine aqueous CH4 still awaits verification, yet recent estimates of global freshwater CH4 production imply that the worldwide energy demand could be satisfied by using the "biofuel"building up in lakes and wetlands. Biogenic CH4 is mostly generated from biomass produced through atmospheric CO2 uptake. Its exploitation in freshwaters can thus secure large amounts of carbon-neutral energy, helping to sustain the planetary equilibrium. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cellulase-mimetic solid acid catalysts (CMSAC), having both cellulose-binding and catalytic sites, are known to have much lower activation energy and higher catalytic activity than traditional solid acid catalysts. It is an emerging greener and cost-friendly solution for producing biofuel, such as bio-hydrogen, from lignocellulose. However, in 2018 the widely used CMSAC, sulfonated chloromethyl polystyrene, was found to have its catalytic activity attributed to the in-situ release of HCl during catalytic hydrolysis, which is unexpected. An ab initio quantum calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) is performed to study its reaction mechanism. Results have shown that the most probable mechanism responsible for the in-situ release of HCl is through SN1 nucleophilic substitution. The simulation also predicted a surface reaction activation energy of 1.56 eV (35.97 kcal/mol), along the predicted minimum energy path (MEP). This is the first ab initio study to theoretically predict the HCl leaching mechanism from CMSAC before its industrial application. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Low bulk density, variable moisture content, and particle size of municipal solid waste (MSW) create feeding, handling, storage, and transportation challenges. In this study, MSW bales were size-reduced in stage-1 and stage-2 hammer mill grinders fitted with 50.8-mm and 6.35-, 12.7-, and 19.05-mm screens. Ground MSW was densified further in a pilot-scale briquette press by varying moisture content in the range of 10–25% wet basis (w.b.). At 40% (w.b.) MSW moisture content, the stage-1 grinder fitted with a 50.4-mm screen took about 136 kWh/ton, while the stage-2 grinder fitted with a 19.05-mm screen took about 151 kWh/ton. The bulk density of MSW after stage-1 and stage-2 grinding was about 25–50 kg/m3. Unit bulk and tapped density were in the range of 680–850 kg/m3, 478–315 kg/m3, and 346–540 kg/m3 post briquetting, and 591–830 kg/m3, 295–458 kg/m3, and 319–519 kg/m3 post five days of storage at 20 °C. The durability was about 93.40–98.54% post briquetting, and after five days of storage. Increasing the moisture content and screen size decreased density and improved durability. Briquetting energy increased to 120 kWh/ton at a higher moisture content and larger grind size. MSW flow characteristics improved after briquetting. Higher lignin content (≈30%) and calorific value (19–21 MJ/kg) suggest MSW is suitable for thermochemical conversion. Ash content in the MSW was in the 11.9–14.8% range. CT-scan images of the briquettes showed a network of interconnected pores formed due to compression of various MSW fractions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A rapid and sensitive High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method with photometric and fluorescence detection is developed for routine analysis of 2-Keto-3-deoxy-gluconate (KDG), a catabolite product of pectin and alginate. These polysaccharides are primary-based compounds for biofuel production and for generation of high-value-added products. HPLC is performed, after derivatization of the 2-oxo-acid groups of the metabolite with o-phenylenediamine (oPD), using a linear gradient of trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. Quantification is accomplished with an internal standard method. The gradient is optimized to distinguish KDG from its close structural analogues such as 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI) and 2,5-diketo-3-deoxygluconate (DKII). The proposed method is simple, highly sensitive and accurate for time course analysis of pectin or alginate degradation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Increasing the production of biofuels in some provinces of China may be affected by local water resources (WR). This study analyzed the life-cycle water footprint (WF) of second-generation and non-grain fuels in different natural and technical conditions in different provinces of China. The analysis was doing using the CROPWAT software model, comparing conversion technologies, a sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and a pressure analysis of local WR. The impact of biofuel on the WF and local water load in Northeast, Southwest, Northwest, Central, and South China were analyzed. Results show that the bio-ethanol of Bagasse and Cassava in Guangxi, Sorghum stalk in Jilin, and Paddy Rice straw and Corn cobs in Heilongjiang are the most favorable feedstocks for producing biofuel, with WFs ranging from to 152–967 m3/t. The proportions of grey WF to life-cycle WF for Sorghum straw (61.89%), Corn cob bio-ethanol (60.17%), and Rapeseed biodiesel (85.20%) in China should be reduced compared with the global average WF (less than 50%). The local WR load of Wheat straw in Henan was the highest (K = 1.13) and the local WR load of Bagasse in Guangxi was lowest (K = 0.06). Increasing the output, reducing the value fraction of the crop residue, and reducing chemical fertilizer consumption have the best effect on reducing WF. Biofuel development policies, including adopting well-designed management practices, controlling fertilizer use as much as possible, carrying out nearby bioenergy strategies, and implementing a local multi-cooperation model are proposed. These results can guide provincial decision-making to expand biofuel commercialization in China. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, highly defected and functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF) structures are developed and exploited as catalysts for an esterification reaction for biofuel production. Two systems of multivariate UiO-66 series, namely MTV-UiO-66(COOH)2 and MTV-UiO-66(OH)2 incorporating dicarboxylate and dihydroxy groups, respectively, along with the single component structures, are thus explored for butyl butyrate production. Ratios of functionalized linkers to terephthalic acid are varied and a modulation synthesis approach is employed allowing for high levels of structural defects. The synthesized MOF structures are fully characterized using Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results confirmed the homogeneous incorporation of the functionalized linkers in the structures. The combination of multivariate approach along with modulation synthesis yields structures with catalytic activity higher than those of highly defective fully functionalized structures and close to the homogeneous conventional catalyst used in esterification reactions. Moreover, the ratio of functionalized linkers to terephthalic acid is shown to be very important since not all MTV-UiO-66 performed better than the single-component structure which can be attributed to a combination of factors related to the density of active sites and their accessibility. The most active MTV-UiO-66(OH)2 member, incorporating 52% of functionalized linkers, a defects number of 1.9, and a surface area of 761 m2/g, yielded 92% conversion to butyl butyrate, compared to 95% for H2SO4, and its activity and stability is maintained over 4 consecutive cycles. Furthermore, by using the data of 33 different UiO-66 based catalysts for butyl butyrate production, a weighted linear regression model is suggested to predict the conversion based on the parameters that are concluded to mostly govern the catalytic activity of MOF catalysts. These parameters include the surface area, the catalytic loading, the defects number, and the level of incorporation of BDC, and the functionalized linkers. The weights calculated for each of these parameters indicate that there is a more pronounced effect of active sites density on the conversion when compared to the surface area or the catalyst loading. These conclusions help pave the way for the engineering of MOF-based catalysts in the path of bridging the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis for efficient biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Photosynthetic biomanufacturing is a promising route for green production of biofuels and biochemicals utilizing carbon dioxide and solar energy. Cyanobacteria are important microbial platforms for constructing photosynthetic cell factories. Toward scaled outdoor cultivations in the future, high light and high temperature tolerances of cyanobacterial chassis strains and cell factories would be determinant properties to be optimized. We proposed a convenient strategy for rapidly improving high light and high temperature tolerances of an important cyanobacterial chassis Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and the derived cell factories. Through introduction and isolation of an AtpA-C252F mutation, PCC 7942 mutants with improved high light and high temperature tolerances could be obtained in only 4 days with an antibiotics-free mode. Adopting this strategy, cellular robustness and sucrose synthesizing capacities of a PCC 7942 cell factory were successfully improved. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Zheng, Sun, Zeng, Duan, Luan and Lu.

AB  - Commercial cellulosic biofuel operation requires a reliable, low-cost, and stable feedstock logistic system. One great challenge is its long-term storage at least for one harvest cycle (1 year for agricultural crop residues) with a minimum loss of bulky, geographically dispersed, inflammable, and easily degradable lignocellulosic biomass. This study conducted an investigation of year-round storage of the agricultural crop residue feedstock under the scenario of performing dry acid pretreatment at the distributed regional collection depots, instead of the central biorefinery plant. The dry acid pretreatment method provides a practical basis for the storage operation by its ability for high preservation of polysaccharide solids, highly compacted accumulation density, being free from wastewater generation, low capital investment, and low energy consumption. Three major agricultural crop residues (corn stover, wheat straw, and rice straw) were pretreated by dry acid pretreatment and then stored in their major planting regions under varying natural conditions of temperature, rain and snow fall, humidity, wind, and sunlight. The pretreated corn stover, wheat straw, and rice straw contained approximately 50% (w/w) of moisture, and their high water absorption capacity maintained the crop residues in solid and fine-particle forms without free wastewater generation and flammability. Meanwhile, the pretreated crop residues were of low pH value and contained various inhibitory compounds for microbial growth. The results show that the crop residue feedstocks were well preserved with negligible solid and fermentable sugar loss after year-round storage in different regions. The physical properties, chemical compositions, enzymatic hydrolysis yields, and ethanol fermentability were maintained essentially constant with a few positive exceptions such as the increased hydrolysis yield and reduced inhibitor content. A case study shows that the feedstock transportation cost of the long-term stored feedstocks under the scenario of dry acid pretreatment at collection depots was significantly reduced compared to that of the direct transportation of virgin crop residual feedstocks. This study provided an efficient and practical logistic system for large-scale biorefinery plants. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study reports the application of metallo-stannosilicates as potential inorganic solid matrixes for enzymes immobilization and their use as a heterogenous catalysts in enzymatic transesterification reactions for the conversion of triacylglycerides into fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Several stannosilicates were synthesized and physicochemical characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)-N2 surface area analysis and solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR 29Si and 119Sn nuclei) techniques. The experimental results for enzymes immobilization were promising, especially for a nickel ion-exchanged metallo-stannosilicate, which were able to immobilize 82 ± 6% of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase and also kept a high enzymatic activity (42 ± 3 U mg–1). Systematic catalytic reactions for conversion of refined palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) using some of these stannosilicates enzymes complexes yielded 63.3 ± 0.7% of FAEEs. It is worth noticing that, when the transesterification reaction was performed with (a) the as-made stannosilicate without enzymes and (b) the equivalent amount of immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase in its free form, the FAEEs yield sharply decreased to &lt; 5.0% and 6.3 ± 0.3%, respectively. This result is a clear evidence of a synergistic effect among the metallo-stannosilicates and the immobilized enzymes. © 2021 Atlantis Livros Ltda.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Olive solid waste has been subject to numerous studies to produce ethanol. The process of converting olive solid waste into biofuel (ethanol) depends on the presence of the effects of microorganisms and enzymes on biological sources. The hydrolysis of various components in lignocellulose materials into fermentable sugars and fermentation of the sugars into ethanol fuel. The biomass olive residues were used as a raw material for the production of bioethanol through the use of preliminary treatments and the use Saccharomyces cerevisiae as fermentable yeast. In this study, for the purpose of obtaining a high concentration of ethanol from lignocellulosic materials, olive solid wastes were pretreated with dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4 2%), dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl 5%), liquid ammonia (NH4OH 20%) and Cellulase. The effect of these pretreatments on the raw material used to convert cellulose and hemicellulose into monosaccharaides and the production of ethanol was observed during the fermentation process using Saccharomyces cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions. When using olive solid waste powder, all pretreatment methods (dilute acids, liquid ammonia and cellulase) were found to be efficient for effective dissolution of cellulose and hemicellulose into monosaccharaides. Based on the results obtained from fermentation processes we can conclude that the yeast belong to Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, are high ethanol production and high bioethanol yielding using simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process (SSF) of olive solid waste, the average yield of ethanol was 3.92 g/10 g dry olive solid wastes. The study recommended that olive waste can be used as a raw material for the production of ethanol, which can be used as an alternative biofuel to reduce the phenomenon of environmental pollution and does not affect food security. © 2021.

AB  - Sorghum bicolor, a photosynthetically efficient C4 grass, represents an important source of grain, forage, fermentable sugars, and cellulosic fibers that can be utilized in myriad applications ranging from bioenergy to bioindustrial feedstocks. Sorghum's efficient fixation of carbon per unit time per unit area per unit input has led to its classification as a preferred biomass crop highlighted by its designation as an advanced biofuel by the U.S. Department of Energy. Due to its extensive genetic diversity and worldwide colonization, sorghum has considerable diversity for a range of phenotypes influencing productivity, composition, and sink/source dynamics. To dissect the genetic basis of these key traits, we present a sorghum carbon-partitioning nested association mapping (NAM) population generated by crossing 11 diverse founder lines with Grassl as the single recurrent female. By exploiting existing variation among cellulosic, forage, sweet, and grain sorghum carbon partitioning regimes, the sorghum carbon-partitioning NAM population will allow the identification of important biomassassociated traits, elucidate the genetic architecture underlying carbon partitioning and improve our understanding of the genetic determinants affecting unique phenotypes within Poaceae. We contrast this NAM population with an existing grain population generated using Tx430 as the recurrent female. Genotypic data are assessed for quality by examining variant density, nucleotide diversity, linkage decay, and are validated using pericarp and testa phenotypes to map known genes affecting these phenotypes. We release the 11-family NAM population along with corresponding genomic data for use in genetic, genomic, and agronomic studies with a focus on carbonpartitioning regimes. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Abstract: Several thousand different terpenoid structures are known so far, and many of them are interesting for applications as pharmaceuticals, flavors, fragrances, biofuels, insecticides, or fine chemical intermediates. One prominent example is camphor, which has been utilized since ancient times in medical applications. Especially (−)-camphor is gaining more and more interest for pharmaceutical applications. Hence, a commercial reliable source is needed. The natural sources for (−)-camphor are limited, and the oxidation of precious (−)-borneol would be too costly. Hence, synthesis of (−)-camphor from renewable alpha-pinene would be an inexpensive alternative. As the currently used route for the conversion of alpha-pinene to camphor produces a mixture of both enantiomers, preferably catalytic methods for the separation of this racemate are demanded to yield enantiopure camphor. Enzymatic kinetic resolution is a sustainable way to solve this challenge but requires suitable enzymes. In this study, the first borneol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. ATCC 17453, capable of catalyzing the stereoselective reduction of camphor, was examined. By using a targeted enzyme engineering approach, enantioselective enzyme variants were created with E-values > 100. The best variant was used for the enzymatic kinetic resolution of camphor racemate, yielding 79% of (−)-camphor with an ee of > 99%. Key points: • Characterization of a novel borneol dehydrogenase (BDH) from P. putida. • Development of enantioselective BDH variants for the reduction of camphor. • Enzymatic kinetic resolution of camphor with borneol dehydrogenase.

AB  - Jerusalem artichokes are a perennial crop with high drought tolerance and high value as a raw material to produce biofuels, functional feed, and food. However, there are few comprehensive metabolomic studies on Jerusalem artichokes under drought conditions. Methods: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry were used to identify differential metabolites in Jerusalem artichoke seedling leaves under polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000-simulated drought stress at 0, 18, 24, and 36 h. Results: A total of 661 metabolites and 236 differential metabolites were identified at 0 vs. 18, 18 vs. 24, and 24 vs. 36 h. 146 differential metabolites and 56 common were identified and at 0 vs. 18, 24, and 36 h. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment identified 236 differential metabolites involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and amino acids. Metabolites involved in glycolysis, phenolic metabolism, tricarboxylic cycle, glutamate-mediated proline biosynthesis, urea cycle, amino acid metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, and the met salvage pathway responded to drought stress. Conclusion: A metabolic network in the leaves of Jerusalem artichokes under drought stress is proposed. These results will improve understanding of the metabolite response to drought stress in Jerusalem artichokes and develop a foundation for breeding drought-resistant varieties. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biobutanol is a valuable biochemical and one of the most promising biofuels. Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4 is a hyperbutanol-producing strain. However, its strong autolytic behavior leads to poor cell stability, especially during continuous fermentation, thus limiting the applicability of the strain for longterm and industrial-scale processes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of autolysin genes within the C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum genome related to cell autolysis and further develop more stable strains for enhanced butanol production. First, putative autolysin-encoding genes were identified in the strain based on comparison of amino acid sequence with homologous genes in other strains. Then, by overexpressing all these putative autolysin genes individually and characterizing the corresponding recombinant strains, four key genes were pinpointed to be responsible for significant cell autolysis activities. Further, these key genes were deleted using CRISPR-Cas9. Fermentation characterization demonstrated enhanced performance of the resultant mutants. Results from this study reveal valuable insights concerning the role of autolysins for cell stability and solvent production, and they provide an essential reference for developing robust strains for enhanced biofuel and biochemical production. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Integration of microalgae-based systems with conventional wastewater treatment plants provides an effective alternative to waste stream management. In this work, alkaline and enzymatic pretreatments of a microalgal culture mainly constituted by Chlorella sp. and Scenedesmus sp. and cultivated in wastewater from an industrial winery wastewater treatment plant were assessed. Microalgal enzymatic pretreatments were expected to overcome algal recalcitrancy before anaerobic digestion. pH-induced flocculation at pH 10 and 11 did not enhance microalgal harvesting and solubilisation, achieving a performance similar to that of natural sedimentation. Enzymatic hydrolysis of algal biomass was carried out using three commercial enzymatic cocktails (A, B and C) at two enzymatic doses (1% and 2% (v/v)) over 3 h of exposure time at 37 °C. Since pretreatments at a 1% dose for 0.5 h and 2% dose for 2 h achieved higher solubilisation, they were selected to evaluate the influence of the pretreatment on microalgal anaerobic digestibility. Biochemical methane potential tests showed that the pretreatments increased the methane production of the raw algal biomass 3.6- to 5.3-fold. The methane yield was 9–27% higher at the lower enzyme dose. Hence, microalgae pretreated with enzymes B and C at a 1% dose were co-digested with waste activated sludge (WAS). Even when the enzyme increased the methane yield of the inoculum and the WAS, the methane yield of the raw microalgae and WAS mixture was not significantly different from that obtained when algae were enzymatically pretreated. Nonetheless, co-digestion may achieve the goals of a waste recycled bio-circular economy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Xylose reductase (XR) is an intermediate inducible enzyme of xylose metabolism responsible for the reduction of xylose into xylitol. It is an intracellular enzyme present in various facultative bacteria, yeasts, molds and algae in their cytoplasm. The active site of enzyme is polar in nature which is responsible for acid–base catalysis. The enzyme is folded into (β/α)8 barrel and its substrate specificity is through C-terminal region. XR is an emerging industrially important food enzyme due to its major application in production of xylitol. Xylitol has shown remarkable applications in other industrial sectors such as food, biofuels, pharmaceutical, medical, odontological, textiles and cosmetics. This enzyme has been purified and characterized to understand its physico-chemical properties and stability. Further, robust microbial strains with tolerance towards high substrate concentration and toxic compounds are required to be developed for successful exploitation of XR at industrial level using agrowaste materials. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study presents techno-economic evaluation of a biorefinery concept using biodiesel industry by-products (sunflower meal and crude glycerol) to produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), crude phenolic extracts (CPE) and protein isolate (PI). The PHB production cost at two annual production capacities ($12.5/kg for 2,500 t PHB/year and $7.8/kg for 25,000 t PHB/year) was not cost-competitive to current PHB production processes when the revenues derived from co-products were not considered. Sensitivity analysis projected the economic viability of a biorefinery concept that could achieve a minimum selling price of $1.1/kg PHB similar to polypropylene. The annual PHB production capacity and the identification of marketable end-uses with respective market prices for the co-products CPE and PI were crucial in attaining process profitability. Greenhouse gas emissions (ca. 0.64 kg CO2-eq/kg PHB) and abiotic depletion potential (61.7 MJ/kg PHB) were lower than polypropylene. Biorefining of sunflower meal and crude glycerol could lead to sustainable PHB production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Attainment of a stable and highly active β-xylosidase is of major importance for the efficient and cost-competitive hydrolysis of hemicellulose xylan, as well as for its industrial conversion into biofuels and biochemicals. Here, a recombinant β-xylosidase of the glycoside hydrolase family (GH43) from Bacillus subtilis was produced in Escherichia coli culture, purified, and subsequently immobilized on agarose and chitosan. Glutaraldehyde and glyoxyl groups were evaluated as activating agents to select the most efficient derivative. Multi-point immobilization on agarose led to an extraordinary thermal stability (half-lives 3604 and 164-fold higher than the free enzyme, at 50° and 35 °C, respectively). Even for chitosan activated with glutaraldehyde, a low-cost support, thermal stability of the immobilized enzyme was 326 and 12-fold higher than the free enzyme at 50° and 35°C, respectively. Immobilized enzymes showed no release of any subunit for the agarose-glyoxyl derivative, and only a few ones for the support activated with glutaraldehyde. Most remarkably, the enzyme kinetic behavior after immobilization increased up to 4-fold in relation to the free one. β-xylosidase, a tetrameric enzyme with four identical subunits, exists in equilibrium between the monomeric and oligomeric forms in solution. Depending on the pH of immobilization, the enzyme oligomerization can be favored, thus explaining the hyperactivation phenomenon. Both glyoxyl-agarose and chitosan-glutaraldehyde derivatives were used to catalyze corncob xylan hydrolysis, reaching 72 % conversion, representing a xylose productivity of around 20 g L−1 h−1. After ten 4h-cycles (pH 6.0, 35 °C), the xylan-to-xylose conversion remained approximately unchanged. Therefore, the immobilized β-xylosidases prepared in this work can be of great interest as biocatalysts in a biorefinery context. © 2020

AB  - The Implication (IMPLY) and Inhibition (INHIB) Boolean logic gates were realized using switchable chimeric pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH-Clamp) containing a fused affinity clamp unit recognizing a signal-peptide. The second component of the logic gate was the wild-type PQQ-glucose dehydrogenase working cooperatively with the PQQ-GDH-Clamp enzyme. The IMPLY and INHIB gates were realized using the same enzyme composition activated with differently defined input signals, thus representing reconfigurable logic systems. The logic gates were first tested while operating in a solution with optical analysis of the output signals. Then, the enzymes were immobilized on a buckypaper electrode for electrochemical transduction of the output signals. The switchable modified electrodes mimicking the IMPLY or INHIB logic gates were integrated with an oxygen-reducing electrode modified with bilirubin oxidase to operate as a biofuel cell activated/inhibited by various input signal combinations processed either by IMPLY or INHIB logic gates. The switchable biofuel cell was used as a self-powered device triggering molecule release function controlled by the logically processed molecule signals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Precise and high-resolution coupling of functional proteins with micro-transducers is critical for the manufacture of miniaturized bioelectronic devices. Moreover, electrochemistry on microelectrodes has had a major impact on electrochemical analysis and sensor technologies, since the small size of microelectrode affects the radial diffusion flux of the analyte to deliver enhanced mass transport and electrode kinetics. However, a large technology gap has existed between the process technology associated with such microelectronics and the conventional bio-conjugation techniques that are generally used. Here, we report on a high-resolution and rapid geometric protein self-patterning (GPS) method using solvent-assisted protein-micelle adsorption printing to couple biomolecules onto microelectrodes with a minimum feature size of 5 μm and a printing time of about a minute. The GPS method is versatile for micropatterning various biomolecules including enzymes, antibodies and avidin-biotinylated proteins, delivering good geometric alignment and preserving biological functionality. We further demonstrated that enzyme-coupled microelectrodes for glucose detection exhibited good electrochemical performance which benefited from the GPS method to maximize effective signal transduction at the bio-interface. These microelectrode arrays maintained fast convergent analyte diffusion displaying typical steady-state I–V characteristics, fast response times, good linear sensitivity (0.103 nA mm−2 mM−1, R2 = 0.995) and an ultra-wide linear dynamic range (2–100 mM). Our findings provide a new technical solution for the precise and accurate coupling of biomolecules to a microelectronic array with important implications for the scaleup and manufacture of diagnostics, biofuel cells and bioelectronic devices that could not be realized economically by other existing techniques. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Algal lipids are important molecules to store energy in algae and transfer energy in the marine food chain, and are potential materials for high value nutraceuticals (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids) or biofuel production. However, how lipid biosynthesis is regulated is not well understood in many species including Eutreptiella from the phylum of Euglenozoa. Here, we characterized the fatty acid (FA) profile of an Eutreptiella species isolated from Long Island Sound, USA, using gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) and investigated their biosynthesis pathways by transcriptome sequencing. We discovered 24 types of FAs including a relatively high proportion of long-chain unsaturated FAs. The abundances of C16, C18, and saturated FAs decreased when phosphate in the culture medium was depleted. Among the 24 FAs, docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6∆4,7,10,13,16,19) was most abundant, suggesting that Eutreptiella sp. preferentially invests in the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PFAs). Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that Eutreptiella sp. likely synthesizes LC-PFAs via ∆8 pathway and uses type I and II fatty acid synthases. Using RT–qPCR, we found that some of the lipid synthesis genes, such as β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, fatty acid desaturase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acyl carrier protein, ∆8 desaturase, and Acyl-ACP thioesterase, were more actively expressed during light period, and two carbon fixation genes were up-regulated in the high-lipid illuminated cultures, suggesting a linkage between photosynthesis and lipid production. The lipid profile renders Eutreptiella sp. a nutritional prey and valuable source for nutraceuticals, and the biosynthesis pathway documented here will be useful for future research and applications. © 2020 Phycological Society of America

AB  - Microbial production of natural gas in subsurface organic-rich reservoirs (e.g., coal, shale, oil) can be enhanced by the introduction of amendments (e.g., algal extracts from biofuel production) to stimulate microbial communities to generate “new” methane resources on human timescales, potentially providing a lower carbon energy source. This study tests deuterated water as a tracer to quantify the amount of “new” methane generated and the effectiveness of Microbial Enhancement of Coalbed Methane (MECoM) approaches, as methanogens incorporate hydrogen from formation waters into methane during methanogenesis. Microorganisms (including methanogens), formation water, and coal obtained from the Powder River Basin were used to establish batch reactor stimulation experiments, using algal extracts, in which incremental amounts of deuterated water were added. The greatest amount of methane was produced in the amended coal-associated experiments and there was a consistent uptake of D into microbial methane. The shorter duration (36 days) coal amended experiment had a lower slope (m = 0.31) of δD-CH4 vs. δD-H2O and a similar offset between δD-H2O and δD-CH4 (371.2‰) compared to the longer duration (m = 0.44; 114 days; 358.8‰ offset) experiment, both consistent with the stimulation of primarily acetoclastic methanogenesis. The success of our proof-of-concept laboratory experiments confirms that deuterated water can be used as a quantitative tracer of stimulated coal-associated methanogenic activity. We also provide an example of how it can be applied in field-scale MECoM projects. In addition, deuterated water may serve as a useful tracer for other natural or enhanced subsurface microbial activities, such as microbial enhanced oil recovery or bioremediation of organic contaminants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Biomass slurries, such as those subjected to microwave-assisted alkaline (MAA) pretreatment, will become common substrates for the production of biofuels in the future. While the rheology of acid and ionic liquid pretreated biomass is known, the rheology of alkaline pretreated biomass is not yet reported; hence, the goal of this study was to establish the rheological characteristics of untreated and MAA pretreated sugarcane straw (SC). Methods: Using rotational rheometry and rheological models, the rheology of SC slurries was assessed as a function of particle size and insoluble solids concentration. Results: In the range of 5–17% insoluble solids concentration, the slurries were consistently pseudo-plastic (n = 0.33 ± 0.02), possessed yield stress with their flow accurately described by the Casson rheological model (R2 = 0.98–0.99). The apparent viscosity and yield stress increased by two orders of magnitude with an increase in insoluble solids concentration. Essentially, MAA pretreated slurries exhibited significantly higher values of apparent viscosity and yield stress than the untreated ones, in the range of 55–80% and 21–63% for particle sizes of &lt; 63 µm (P63) and 90–180 µm (P90), respectively. Pretreated P63 samples exhibited higher apparent viscosity and yield stress than the P90. On the other hand, for untreated samples, P63 samples had a reduced apparent viscosity than P90 samples. Conclusion: The results of this study definitively reveal that MAA significantly increases the shear rate dependent shear viscosity values along with the yield stress of biomass slurries. This will, therefore, serve as a benchmark for characterizing other MAA pretreated biomass slurries to guide the design of industrial-scale production equipment.

AB  - Microalgae have the potential to recycle CO2 as starch and triacylglycerol (TAG), which provide alternative source of biofuel and high added-value chemicals. Starch accumulates in the chloroplast, whereas TAG accumulates in the cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LD). Preferential accumulation of starch or TAG may be achieved by switching intracellular metabolic carbon flow, but our knowledge on this control remains limited. Are these two products mutually exclusive? Or, does starch act as a precursor to TAG synthesis, or vice versa? To answer these questions, we analyzed carbon flow in starch and lipids using a stable isotope 13C in Chlamydomonas debaryana NIES-2212, which accumulates, without nutrient limitation, starch in the exponential growth phase and TAG in the stationary phase. Pulse labeling experiments as well as pulse labeling and chase experiments were conducted, and then, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on starch-derived glucose and lipid-bound fatty acids. We exploited the previously developed method of isotopomer analysis to estimate the proportion of various pools with different isotopic abundance. Starch turned over rapidly to provide carbon for the synthesis of fatty acids in the exponential phase cells. Most fatty acids showed rapid and slow components of metabolism, whereas oleic acid decayed according to a single exponential curve. Highly labeled population of fatty acids that accumulated during the initial labeling decreased rapidly, and replaced by low abundance population during the chase time, indicating that highly labeled fatty acids were degraded and the resulting carbons were re-used in the re-synthesis with about 9-fold unlabeled, newly fixed carbons. Elongation of C16–C18 acids in vivo was indicated by partially labeled C18 acids. The accumulation of TAG in the stationary growth phase was accounted for by both de novo synthesis and remodeling of membrane lipids. These results suggest that de novo synthesis of starch and TAG was rapid and transient, and also almost independent to each other, but there is a pool of starch quickly turning over for the synthesis of fatty acids. Fatty acids were also subject to re-synthesis. Evidence was also provided for remodeling of lipids, namely, re-use of acyl groups in polar lipids for TAG synthesis. © Copyright © 2021 Sato and Toyoshima.

AB  - Being a microbial host for lignocellulosic biofuel production, Saccharomyces cerevisiae needs to be engineered to express a heterologous xylose pathway; however, it has been challenging to optimize the engineered strain for efficient and rapid fermentation of xylose. Deletion of PHO13 (Δpho13) has been reported to be a crucial genetic perturbation in improving xylose fermentation. A confirmed mechanism of the Δpho13 effect on xylose fermentation is that the Δpho13 transcriptionally activates the genes in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In the current study, we found a couple of engineered strains, of which phenotypes were not affected by Δpho13 (Δpho13-negative), among many others we examined. Genome resequencing of the Δpho13-negative strains revealed that a loss-of-function mutation in GCR2 was responsible for the phenotype. Gcr2 is a global transcriptional factor involved in glucose metabolism. The results of RNA-seq confirmed that the deletion of GCR2 (Δgcr2) led to the upregulation of PPP genes as well as downregulation of glycolytic genes, and changes were more significant under xylose conditions than those under glucose conditions. Although there was no synergistic effect between Δpho13 and Δgcr2 in improving xylose fermentation, these results suggested that GCR2 is a novel knockout target in improving lignocellulosic ethanol production. © Copyright © 2021 Shin, Park, Kim, Oh, Jeong, Florencia, Kim, Jin and Kim.

AB  - Methane, one of the six major greenhouse gases, poses a serious environmental problem with the potential for global warming 20 times that of CO2. Although a large amount of methane is generated worldwide, its recovery and utilization are very low. One of the environmentally friendly ways to use methane is the biological gas-to-liquids (Bio-GTL) process, in which methane is biologically converted to useful products by microorganisms. Methanotrophs are strains that can convert methane to methanol at ambient conditions using methane monooxygenase (MMO). Here, we report an efficient phase-transfer catalysis system for methane-to-methanol conversion using methanotrophs. The methanotroph used in the work is Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z of which the methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) enzyme is removed to enhance methanol accumulation. The phase-transfer catalysis system does not require any separation processes and facilitates the mass transfer of methane gas, thereby increasing the methanol productivity and lowering the production cost. The methanol productivity is 0.717 g/L/h, which is superior to the results reported to date. In addition, the use of a cellulose-membrane reactor system enables multiple biocatalytic reactions without a significant decrease in productivity. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Thermotoga maritima (Tma) contains genes encoding various hyperthermophilic enzymes with great potential for industrial applications. The gene TM1752 in Tma genome has been annotated as cellulase gene encoding protein Cel5B. In this work, the gene TM1752 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized. Interestingly, the purified enzyme exhibited specific activities of 416 and 215 U/mg on substrates galactomannan and carboxy methyl cellulose, which is the highest among thermophilic mannanases. However, the putative enzyme did not show sequence homology with any of the previously reported mannanases; therefore, the enzyme Cel5B was identified as bifunctional mannanase and cellulase and renamed as Man/Cel5B. Man/Cel5B exhibited maximum activity at 85°C and pH 5.5. This enzyme retained more than 50% activity after 5 h of incubation at 85°C, and retained up to 80% activity after incubated for 1 h at pH 5–8. The Km and Vmax of Man/Cel5B were observed to be 4.5 mg/mL galactomannan and 769 U/mg, respectively. Thin layer chromatography depicted that locust bean gum could be efficiently degraded to mannobiose, mannotriose, and mannooligosaccharides by Man/Cel5B. These characteristics suggest that Man/Cel5B has attractive applications for future food, feed, and biofuel industries. © Copyright © 2021 Sadaqat, Sha, Rupani, Wang, Zuo and Shao.

AB  - In recent years, the use of microalgae as feedstock for many marketable products, such as animal/ aqua feeds, bioplastics and fertilizers, has gained renewed interest due to their fast growth potential coupled with relatively high lipid, carbohydrate and nutrient content. An algal biorefinery at an industrial site has the potential to sustainably and profitably convert carbon dioxide emissions into microalgal biomass and concomitantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewaters. Industrial wastewaters are a potential alternative to traditional media used for large-scale microalgal cultivation. Pulp and paper mills are major consumers of water resources and discharge a huge amount of water to nearby lakes or rivers. This study investigated whether pulp and paper mill waste water is suitable for microalgal cultivation with the aim of achieving significant biomass production. Six different process waters from one Canadian pulp and paper mill were tested with two freshwater green microalgae. All of these waters were unable to support growth of microalgae due to inadequate nutrient concentrations, colour, turbidity and possible toxicity issues. © 2021 The Authors Water Science & Technology.

AB  - Thermal hydrolysis is a common pre-treatment, used before anaerobic digestion processes, to enhance the hydrolysis rate. However, formation of inhibitory compounds and the increase of liquid fraction colour have been identified as potential drawbacks. This study was oriented to study the methane production from simple substrates, subjected to thermal hydrolysis. A mixture of glycine and glucose at different concentrations was prepared, at a ratio similar to proteins and carbohydrates found in activated sludge. Two temperatures were tested. At 120 °C a decrease on biogas production rate was observed. On the other hand, at 165 °C generation of recalcitrant material was observed, causing a decrease in methane potential and COD degradation, when a mixture of glycine and glucose was used as substrate. This was atributed to the formation of recalcitrant compounds via Maillard reaction, hyphothesis supported by FTIR-ATR, which indicated the formation of amide II Bonds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this regard, it is remarkable that duckweeds (Lemnaceae) like Wolffia globosa could remove nitrogen especially NH4+, NO3− and phosphorus efficiently from wastewater (Mohedano et al., 2012) and aquaculture effluents (Suppadit et al., 2008) and produce highly useful natural resource-rich in high-quality protein (Rusoff et al., 1980), starch (Xiao et al., 2013), and bioactive compounds like antioxidant, phenols and flavonoids and carotenoids (Gulcin et al., 2010). Accordingly, Wolffia was utilized as an effective and efficient live feed for Labeo rohita (Pradhan et al., 2019) and as source of both protein and carotenoid for ornamental fish (Gogoi et al., 2018). Further, duckweeds are also useful for the development of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products (Kotowska et al., 2013), animal feed (Hassan and Edwards, 1992), biofuel, bioethanol (Cheng and Stomp, 2009) and bioplastics (Zeller et al., 2013). On the other hand, mussels like Lamellidens marginalis remove algae, bacteria, pollutants, nutrients, and organic compounds from the water at high rates via filter-feeding (Baby et al., 2010) and act as a link between a water body and its sediment by regulating the phytoplankton community structure and nutrient exchange at the water-sediment interface by bioturbation (Vaughn et al., 2008). It is also remarkable that the Lamellidens spp. are widely utilized as food and freshwater pearl-producing animal in India and Bangladesh. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study projects the baseline work for bio-conversion of pine needles to second generation biofuel, which deals mainly with screening, molecular identification and optimization of process parameters for cellulase and xylanase production. In total, 89 hydrolytic enzymes producing isolates were isolated from the soils and ten potential enzyme producers (seven for cellulase and three for xylanase) were subjected to secondary screening by inducing physical and chemical mutation. The wild and mutant strains of hypercellulase producers N12 and Kd1 were identified as Bacillus stratosphericus N12 and Bacillus altitudinis Kd1 using 16S rRNA technique. The fungal isolates RF1 and F2 were identified on the basis of 5.8 rRNA ITS technique and identified as Rhizopus oryzae, RF1 and Rhizopus delemar, F2 respectively. The mutant strains B. stratosphericus N12 (M) and B. altitudinis Kd1 (M) are highly stable till 10 generations. Cellulase activity increased from 3.230 to 5.983 IU, i.e. 85.23% increase in cellulase activity was achieved. Xylanase production increased from 51.32 to 95.25 IU with 85.60% increase in production. Solid-state fermentation was also performed by potential fungal strains, i.e. R. delemar F2 and R. oryzae RF1 using pine needles as the substrate. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the designs of redox polymers have become critical to the field of mediated bioelectrocatalysis and are used in commercial glucose biosensors, as well as other bioelectrochemical applications (e.g., energy harvesting). These polymers are specifically used to immobilize redox mediators on electrode surfaces, allowing for self-exchange-based conduction of electrons from enzymes far from the electrode to the electrode surface. However, the synthesis of redox polymers is challenging and results in large batch-to-batch variability. Herein, we report a rapid entrapment of mediators for NAD+-dependent bioelectrocatalysis within reverse ionically condensed polyelectrolytes. A high ionic strength aqueous solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, composed of cationic polyguanidinium (PG) chloride and anionic sodium hexametaphosphate (P6), undergoes phase inversion into a solid microporous polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) when introduced into a low ionic strength aqueous solution. The ionic strength-triggered phase inversion of PGP6 solutions was investigated as a means to entrap mediators on the surface of electrodes for mediated bioelectrocatalysis. Compared to the traditional cross-linked immobilizations using redox polymers, this phase inversion takes place within seconds and requires up to 60 min for complete stabilization. In this work, redox mediator phenazine ethosulfate (PES) was entrapped within PGP6 on electrode surfaces for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent bioelectrocatalysis. In the bulk solution, NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes catalyze the oxidation of the substrate while reducing NAD to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The resulting NADH is reoxidized to NAD+ by the entrapped PES that gets reduced on the electrode, completing the NAD+-regeneration-based bioelectrocatalysis. To show the use of these new materials in an application, biofuel cells were evaluated using four different anodic enzyme systems (alcohol dehydrogenase, lactate hydrogenase, glycerol dehydrogenase, and glucose dehydrogenase). © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The net energy ratio (NER) of microalgae biofuels depends fundamentally on assumptions of operational energy demand and biomass yield. However, for the NER calculation, it has not previously been considered that these parameters are related. This study derives a correlation between these values from published experimental data on flat plate photobioreactors and uses it to calculate the NER. The found correlation is adapted to outdoor conditions, and the energy demand throughout the life cycle for cultivation and biogas production is added. Results show that an asymptotic correlation between the aeration rate and the photosynthetic efficiency hampers net energy output. Maximising the biomass output requires a disproportionately high aeration rate, and thus operational energy demand. Best NER is obtained at low aeration rates, however the biomethane yield at these rates cannot compensate for the total energy demand throughout the life cycle. A NER of 3.6 is calculated. Sensitivity analysis on further technological improvements, such as more efficient energy supply, reduces the NER to 1.8. A comparison of assumptions from seven previous life cycle analyses demonstrates that NER below one results from incomplete system boundaries, or unrelated parameters for operational energy demand and biomass yield. Our findings help to explain contradictory results in previous studies, and will improve the quality of future NER analyses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mesophilic and thermophilic digestion has long been considered as preferred temperature ranges for anaerobic digestion. However, in this study, the effects of temperatures (37, 42, 47, and 55 °C) on the biomethane potential of corn stover were conducted with batch experiments, and the highest biomethane potential was at 42 °C. It was inferred that the change of feed materials, e.g., pretreatment caused by acidification (pH 6.0) during the lag time (4 days), was the main driver for higher biomethane potential. The natural pretreatment stimulated by a slight digestive temperature increase to 42 °C can enhance the biomethane potential of corn stover without adding extra acid. Meanwhile, metabolic pathways of methanogens changed from acetoclastic to mixotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Based on these results, the transition temperature (42 °C) from mesophilic to thermophilic micro-organisms could be a promising option for corn stover anaerobic digestion. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increasing energy needs have led to soaring fossil fuel consumption, which has caused several environmental problems. These environmental aspects along with the energy demand have motivated the search for new energy systems. In this context, biofuels such as biodiesel have been developing into a substitute for conventional fuels. Microalgae are considered a promising option for biodiesel production due to their high lipid content. Therefore, it is important to analyze the technical aspects of the biodiesel production system. In this work, the inherent safety analysis of three emerging topologies for biodiesel production from microalgae was performed using the inherent safety index (ISI) methodology. Selected topologies include biodiesel production via lipid extraction and transesterification, in-situ transesterification, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The results revealed that the processes are inherently unsafe achieving total inherent safety index scores of 30, 29, and 36. The main risks in the cases were associated with the chemical safety index. Operating conditions represented no risk for topologies 1 and 2, while for topology 3 pressure and temperature were identified as critical variables. In general, topology 2 showed better performance from a safety perspective. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biofuels from micro-organisms represents a possible response to the carbon dioxide mitiga-tion. One open problem is to improve their productivity, in terms of biofuels production. To do so, an improvement of the present model of growth and production is required. However, this implies an understanding of the growth spontaneous conditions of the bacteria. In this paper, a thermodynamic approach is developed in order to highlight the fundamental role of the electrochemical potential in bacteria proliferation. Temperature effect on the biosystem behaviour has been pointed out. The results link together the electrochemical potential, the membrane electric potential, the pH gradient through the membrane, and the temperature, with the result of improving the thermodynamic approaches, usually introduced in this topic of research. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Organosolv fractionation is a promising approach for the separation of lignocellulosic components in integrated biorefineries where each component can be fully valorized into valuable platform chemicals and biofuels. In this study, microwave-accelerated organosolv fractionation was developed for the modification of lignocellulosic fractionation of rice husk. The fractionation condition was optimized for 1 h with the microwave irradiation at 300 W using a ternary solvent mixture composed of 24%:32%:44% water/ethanol/methyl isobutyl ketone. The effects of mineral acids (HCl, H3PO4, and H2SO4) and heterogeneous acid promoters (HCl, H3PO4, and H2SO4 impregnated over activated carbon) on the efficiency and selectivity of product yields (i.e., glucan, hemicellulose-derived products, and lignin) were also investigated. It was found that the use of H3PO4-activated carbon as the promoter showed superior performance on the fractionation of rice husk components, resulting in 88.8% recovery of cellulose, with 63.8% purity in the solid phase, whereas the recovery of hemicellulose (66.4%) with the lowest formation of furan and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural and lignin (81.0%) without sugar cross-contamination was obtained in the aqueous ethanol phase and organic phase, respectively. In addition, the morphology structure of fractionated rice husk presented 2.6-fold higher surface area (5.4 m2/g) of cellulose-enriched fraction in comparison with the native rice husk (2.1 m2/g), indicating the improvement of enzyme accessibility. Besides, the chemical changes of isolated lignin were also investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. This work gives pieces of information into the efficiencies of the microwave strategy as a climate neighborly elective fractionation method for this serious starting material in the biotreatment facility business. ©

AB  - Today one of the most interesting ways to produce biodiesel is based on the use of oleaginous microorganisms, which can accumulate microbial oil with a composition similar to vegetable oils. In this paper, we present a thermo-chemical numerical model of the yeast biodiesel production process, considering cardoon stalks as raw material. The simulation is performed subdividing the process into the following sections: steam explosion pre-treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, lipid production, lipid extraction, and alkali-catalyzed transesterification. Numerical results show that 406.4 t of biodiesel can be produced starting from 10,000 t of lignocellulosic biomass. An economic analysis indicates a biodiesel production cost of 12.8 USD/kg, thus suggesting the need to increase the capacity plant and the lipid yield to make the project economically attractive. In this regard, a sensitivity analysis is also performed considering an ideal lipid yield of 22% and 100,000 t of lignocellulosic biomass. The biodiesel production costs related to these new scenarios are 7.88 and 5.91 USD/kg, respectively. The large capacity plant combined with a great lipid yield in the fermentation stage shows a biodiesel production cost of 3.63 USD/kg making the product competitive on the current market of biofuels by microbial oil. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The mutualistic interactions between the oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi and the green microalga Chloroidium saccharophilum in mixed cultures were investigated to exploit possible synergistic effects. In fact, microalga could act as an oxygen generator for the yeast, while the yeast could provide carbon dioxide to microalga. The behavior of the two microorganisms alone and in mixed culture was studied in two synthetic media (YEG and BBM + G) before moving on to a real model represented by the hydrolysate of Arundo donax, used as low-cost feedstock, and previously subjected to steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis. The overall lipid content and lipid productivity obtained in the mixed culture of YEG, BBM + G and for the hydrolysate of Arundo donax were equal to 0.064, 0.064 and 0.081 glipid·gbiomass−1 and 30.14, 35.56 and 37.22 mglipid·L−1·day−1, respectively. The mixed cultures, in all cases, proved to be the most performing compared to the individual ones. In addition, this study provided new input for the integration of Single Cell Oil (SCO) production with agro-industrial feedstock, and the fatty acid distribution mainly consisting of stearic (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) allows promising applications in biofuels, cosmetics, food additives and other products of industrial interest. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Semi-natural grassland habitats are most often limited to animal grazing and low intensity farming. Their potential in bioenergy production is complicated due to the heterogeneity, variation, accessibility, and need for complex pre-treatment/hydrolysis techniques to convert into valuable products. In this research, fermentable sugar production efficiency from various habitats at various vegetation periods was evaluated. The highest fermentable sugar yields (above 0.2 g/g volatile solids) over a period of 3 years were observed from habitats “xeric and calcareous grasslands” (Natura 2000 code: 6120) and “semi-natural dry grasslands and scrubland facies on calcareous substrates” (Natura 2000 code: 6210). Both had a higher proportion of dicotyledonous plants. At the same time, the highest productivity (above 0.7 t sugar/ha) was observed from lowland hay meadows in the initial stage of the vegetation. Thus, despite variable yield-affecting factors, grasslands can be a potential resource for energy production. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The seaweed, Gracilaria verrucosa (red seaweed) was fermented to produce bioethanol. Optimal thermal acid hydrolysis conditions were determined as 200 mM H2SO4 and 10% (w/v) seaweed slurry at 130℃ for 60 min yielding 47.5% of pretreatment efficiency (Ep). After the thermal acid hydrolysis, enzymatic saccharification was carried out with 16 U/ml Viscozyme L, Cellic CTec2 or mixture of Viscozyme L and Cellic CTec2 to G. verrucosa hydrolysates. Enzymatic saccharifications with Viscozyme, Cellic CTec2 or mixture of those yielded 7.3 g/l glucose with efficiency of saccharification, Es = 34.9%, 11.6 g/l glucose with Es = 64.4% and the mixture of those 9.6 g/l glucose with Es = 56.6%, respectively. Therefore, based on the Es value, Cellic CTec2 was selected for the optimal enzyme for enzymatic saccharification of G. verrucosa hydrolysate. The ethanol productions with non-adapted S. cerevisiae CEN-PK2 (wild type) and S. cerevisiae CEN-PK2 with adaptive evolution to galactose produced 8.5 g/l ethanol with YEtOH = 0.19 and 21.5 g/l ethanol with YEtOH = 0.50 at 144 h, respectively. From these results, the ethanol production by S. cerevisiae with adaptive evolution showed high concentration of ethanol production using G. verrucosa as a substrate. © 2021, The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology

AB  - The progressive and enhanced thermal mechanisms of nanoparticles has motivated re-searchers to give attention to this topic in recent years. The synthesizing and versatile applications of such materials include cooling and heating controlling processes, solar systems, energy produc-tion, nanoelectronics, hybrid-powered motors, cancer treatments, and renewable energy systems. Moreover, the bioconvection of nanofluids allows for some motivating applications in this era of bioengineering and biotechnology, such as biofuels, biosensors, and enzymes. With these inter-esting motivations and applications, this study elucidated upon the three-dimensional bioconvec-tion flow of a Sisko fluid (base fluid) in the presence of a nanofluid over a stretched surface. The additional thermal features of radiation were also incorporated to modify the analysis. The rheo-logical features of shear thinning and shear thickening that are associated with the Sisko nanofluid were comprehensively studied. The problem was formulated using highly nonlinear and coupled differential equations, which were numerically simulated via a shooting scheme. The salient physical applications of flow parameters were graphically underlined in view of shear-thinning and shear-thickening scenarios. The results showed that a decrease in velocity in the presence of buoyancy ratio forces was more conducive to the shear-thinning phenomenon. The increase in temperature profile due the thermal Biot number and surface heating source parameter seemed to be more inflated in the shear-thinning scenario. A lower motile microorganism profile was noted for the bioconvection Lewis number. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Many abiotic factors impact the yield and growth of Brassica carinata (commonly referred to as carinata or Ethiopian mustard). Very little is known about carinata and how mineral nutrients impact its growth, and more specifically, the sufficiency values for fertility over the plant’s growth cycle and life stages. This study explored the impacts that plant nutrients, specifically micronutrients, can have on the growth and development of carinata over its distinct life stages (rosette, bolting, flowering, and pod set). Plants were grown under varying micronutrient concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, 87.5, and 100%) of a modified Hoagland’s solution. Data were collected on plant height, canopy diameter, leaf tissue mineral nutrient concentrations, and biomass. The results demonstrated that micronutrient fertility has profound impacts on the production of Brassica carinata during different life stages. Boron (B) exclusion had the greatest impact on the growth and reproduction of Brassica carinata, with the death of the apical meristem that resulted in a lack of siliques or seeds at the lowest rate. Optimal relative elemental leaf tissue concentrations varied among micronutrient fertility concentrations and life stages. Certain elements exhibited linear increases in nutrient leaf tissue accumulation as solution concentration increased without reaching a maximum concentration during specific life stages. Other life stages and/or elements produced distinct plateau leaf tissue mineral concentrations despite increasing fertility treatment concentrations such as B in the rosette stage (47.2–50.0 mg·kg−1), copper (Cu) (bolting stage at 6.62–7.57 mg·kg−1), zinc (Zn) (bolting stage at 27.47–39.87 and flowering at 33.98–43.50 mg·kg−1), molybdenum (Mo) (flowering stage at 2.42–3.23 mg·kg−1), and manganese (Mn) (bolting stage at 117.03–161.63 mg·kg−1). This work demonstrates that Brassica carinata has different fertility demands and will accumulate differing leaf tissue concentrations during its life stages. This work serves as a baseline for further uptake and portioning work for Brassica carinata. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In the present research, activated carbon-supported sulfonic acid catalysts were synthesized and tested as pretreatment agents for the conversion of switchgrass into glucose. The catalysts were synthesized by reacting sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, and p-toluenesulfonic acid with activated carbon. The characterization of catalysts suggested an increase in surface acidities, while surface area and pore volumes decreased because of sulfonation. Batch experiments were performed in 125 mL serum bottles to investigate the effects of temperature (30, 60, and 90◦C), reaction time (90 and 120 min) on the yields of glucose. Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated switchgrass using Ctec2 yielded up to 57.13% glucose. Durability tests indicated that sulfonic solid-impregnated carbon catalysts were able to maintain activity even after three cycles. From the results obtained, the solid acid catalysts appear to serve as effective pretreatment agents and can potentially reduce the use of conventional liquid acids and bases in biomass-into-biofuel production. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The bio-flocculation ability of UTEX 2341 was studied for the purpose of improving microalgae harvesting efficiency to cut the high cost of biofuel production. The algae cells of UTEX 2341 cultured under heterotrophic and municipal wastewater conditions were found to have better self-flocculation ability, with flocculation rates of 92% and 85% at 2 h, respectively. Moreover, the flocculation rates of 16 freeze-dried microalgae powder samples cultured under different stress conditions were 0~72% with an algae powder dosage of 35 mg L−1 . The flocculation efficiency of DIM, DCd1, DT28, and L6S was stable under different pH of 3~9 and temperatures of 15~50◦ C. For samples of IM, LCd0.6, LMn2, and LZn2, the flocculation efficiency decreased or increased respectively with increased pH or temperatures. Though the flocculation properties of the eight samples showed wide differences, their flocculant compositions were almost the same with unknown components occupying large proportions. More studies needed to be further carried out to reveal the flocculation mechanisms and analyze the flocculation abilities in practical application, which would be conducive to future large-scale application of the bio-flocculation method and also cost reduction. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial warm-season grass that can serve dual purposes, forage and biofuel feedstock. Because the cell wall accounts for more than half the dry matter weight, breeding for both objectives will largely depend on cell wall components which include cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. We used NIRS to measure crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, hemicellulose, cellulose, and Klason lignin to conduct QTL mapping in an F1 population derived from a cross between tetraploid lowlands AP13 and B6 with 285 progenies. Of the three major cell wall components of the dry matter, cellulose was the highest (34.51–41.40%), followed by hemicellulose (25.48–33.55%), and Klason lignin (9.70–13.23%). Mapping of biomass and forage quality traits was done using two linkage maps with 2772 SNP markers. We identified 37 significant QTL for all six traits with the highest percentage variance explained by individual QTL in all traits ranging from 4.89 to 8.57%. There are 9 chromosome regions with colocalized QTL of different traits, indicating either pleiotropic gene action or tight linkage between the genes. Improvement of switchgrass for forage and biofuel feedstock quality would benefit from the selection of QTL that contribute directly to the target phenotypes. The frequency of favorable QTL alleles can be enhanced through Genomic Selection. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are usually appended to carbohydrateactive enzymes (CAZymes) and serve to potentiate catalytic activity, for example, by increasing substrate affinity. The Gram-negative soil saprophyte Cellvibrio japonicus is a valuable source for CAZyme and CBM discovery and characterization due to its innate ability to degrade a wide array of plant polysaccharides. Bioinformatic analysis of the CJA_2959 gene product from C. japonicus revealed a modular architecture consisting of a fibronectin type III (Fn3) module, a cryptic module of unknown function (X181), and a glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 4 (GH5_4) catalytic module. We previously demonstrated that the last of these, CjGH5F, is an efficient and specific endo-xyloglucanase (M. A. Attia, C. E. Nelson, W. A. Offen, N. Jain, et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 11:45, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1039-6). In the present study, C-terminal fusion of superfolder green fluorescent protein in tandem with the Fn3X181 modules enabled recombinant production and purification from Escherichia coli. Native affinity gel electrophoresis revealed binding specificity for the terminal galactosecontaining plant polysaccharides galactoxyloglucan and galactomannan. Isothermal titration calorimetry further evidenced a preference for galactoxyloglucan polysaccharide over short oligosaccharides comprising the limit-digest products of CjGH5F. Thus, our results identify the X181 module as the defining member of a new CBM family, CBM88. In addition to directly revealing the function of this CBM in the context of xyloglucan metabolism by C. japonicus, this study will guide future bioinformatic and functionalanalyses across microbial (meta)genomes. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Lignin is often considered an underutilized carbon source for the production of biofuels and other value-added compounds. Depolymerized lignin results in a collection of different aromatic compounds that have their own metabolic pathways for conversion into central metabolites. This investigation describes the chemical crosstalk of compounds between different metabolic pathways involved in the catabolism of lignin. Specifically, seven compounds were identified as inhibitors of the dioxygenase DesB. The most potent inhibitor, protocatechuate, moderately impacts both vmax and KM of DesB (71 s−1 and 167 μM versus 130 s−1 and 123 μM, in the presence and absence of protocatechuate, respectively) suggesting a mixed (competitive and non-competitive) inhibition profile. Molecular docking identified a putative allosteric pocket adjacent to the active site, in a position analogous to one identified previously for a related dioxygenase. This work demonstrates that lignin catabolic pathway intermediates can modulate the activity of multiple enzymes within the lignin degradation pathway and need to be considered when engineering organisms to utilize lignin for biomass conversion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The damaging effect and challenges associated with the use of fossil fuel is enormous and very costly. Biofuels could be obtained from plant biomass wastes which are known to be sources of environmental pollution and breeding grounds for vectors of diseases. Sugarcane bagasse was exploited as a renewable substrate for obtaining bioethanol using Streptomyces strain COB KF977550 as inoculum. Submerged aerobic batch fermentation was performed in flasks containing mineral salts medium supplemented with 5.0 g (w/v) sugarcane bagasse. Incubation was done in a shaker (150 rpm) at 30 °C for 21 days. Microbial growth was assessed by measurement of the optical density (O.D 600nm) at 3-day intervals. Fractional distillation was carried out in batch mode using a simple fractional distillation setup. Metabolic products were determined using GC-FID. Further analyses were performed using FTIR and GC-MS. The optical density of S.coelicolor strain COB KF977550 increased from 0.9 to 1.41. The GC-FID showed that 43.08 g/L ethanol was generated. Interestingly, the results showed the presence of diverse biochemicals released into the medium in addition to the main product ethanol. Ten carboxylic acids including formic acid, glycolic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, n-valeric acid, and 3-hydroxybutyric acid were identified as biochemical organic acids by-products. © 2021

AB  - A simple and highly selective analytical procedure is presented for the determination of cellulosic glucan content in samples that contain both cellulose and starch. This method eliminates the unacceptably large compounding errors of current two-measurement methods. If both starch and cellulose are present before analytical hydrolysis, both will be hydrolyzed to glucose causing bias and inaccuracy in the method. To prevent this interference, the removal of starch prior to cellulosic quantification is crucial. The method presented here is a concise in-series procedure with minimal measurements, eliminating large compounding errors. Sample preparation consists of a starch extraction employing enzymatic hydrolysis followed by a simple filtration and wash. The samples are then subjected to a two-stage acid hydrolysis. The concentration of glucose is determined by ion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography with a Pb2+ column and a refractive index detector. The cellulosic glucan content is calculated based on the initial dry weight of the starting material. Data for the native biomass materials studied show excellent reproducibility, with coefficients of variance of 3.0% or less associated with the method. This selectivity for cellulosic glucan by the procedure was validated with several analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC–MS), Raman spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Caulobacter crescentus (C. crescentus) has a single celA gene encoding the bacterial cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) of the GH9 family that is induced at transcriptional levels (q-PCR) by agroindustrial residues. Corn straw (1%, w/v) was more efficient in inducing bacterial mRNA-celA expression than corn cob (1%, w/v) and a parallel protein expression profile was observed, since enzyme activity was also higher in presence of corn straw in the bacterium. In order to evaluate the biotechnological role of cellulase from C. crescentus (NA1000), the celA gene of 1,878 bp (CCNA_02310) was cloned in the pTrCHisA vector and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant cellulase CelA purified showed 73 kDa, specificity to CMC, optimal pH of 5.5 and pH stability of 6, optimal temperature at 40 °C and thermostability at 35 °C, KM = 0.66 mg/mL and VMax = 2.41 U/mg/min. CelA was strongly activated by ions Mn2+ (70%), Sn2+ (49%) and Co2+ (46%) and was efficient in the hydrolysis of corn straw and corn cob (1%; w/v) releasing 2.62 µmol/mL and 1.02 µmol/mL of reducing sugar, respectively, being an alternative for the production of chemicals and biofuels. CelA was applied directly to the jeans fiber and scanning electron micrographs (SEM) generated showed a clean and smooth surface of the fibers compared to the control, indicating the application of enzyme for the biopolishing of denim jeans. This work supports a set of biotechnological capabilities of cellulase from C. crescentus suggested by the bacterial genomic sequence that has not been described yet.

AB  - Microalgal lipids and fatty acids are important components for achieving biofuel because of their potential high productivity. Although fatty acids that have a hydroxy group adjacent to the end of the acyl chain might be an important chemical feedstock, most algae do not accumulate it. To produce (ω−1)-hydroxy fatty acids from 3-hydroxybutylyl-CoA, an intermediate for polyhydroxybutylate biosynthesis in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we expressed a gene for the promiscuous 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III from Alicyclobacillus acidocalderius (aaKASIII) by the cpc560 promoter. To supply 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoAs for aaKASIII, the phaC gene for polyhydroxybutylate polymerase was deleted, and the phaAB genes for 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthesis from Cupriavidus necator were overexpressed. The genetically modified strain synthesized 15-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, 17-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, and 17-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid, and accumulated approximately 2.1 mol% of (ω−1)-hydroxy fatty acids in total fatty acids under illumination with 70 μmol photons m−2 s−1, although its growth was severely retarded. Under weak light (35 μmol photons m−2 s−1) conditions, the strain grew as well as the wild-type and showed lower hydroxy fatty acids (0.04 mol%) accumulation than that at higher illumination levels. The photosynthetic activity of this strain was lower than that of wild-type cells, suggesting that high light conditions enhanced hydroxy fatty acids production and inhibited photosynthesis. (ω−1)-Hydroxy fatty acids were not predominantly observed in the galactolipids from thin-layer chromatography, which are the major lipid classes in cyanobacteria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on photoautotrophic production of fatty acids possessing a functional group near the end of the acyl chain in cyanobacteria. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enzyme consumption is a key cost in the lignocellulosic sugar route for production of biofuels and chemicals, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a low-cost additive that improves hydrolysis efficiency. Despite many studies in this area, the relation of benefit over cost of PEG addition remains unclear. This article describes principles for expressing the effect of PEG as an equivalent enzyme amount, by merging PEG adsorption kinetics with a standardized enzyme dosage response. This model allows cost optimization of PEG addition by marginal analysis, as a function of enzyme dosage, solids concentration and price-ratio of enzyme and PEG. The model is based on the novel observations that the relative increase in apparent enzyme dosage by PEG addition is constant regardless of the absolute enzyme dosage, and that the increase correlates linearly with adsorption of PEG on hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw. The optimum ranged for most cases between 7 and 14 mg PEG per g substrate. The addition of PEG was attractive only above a threshold price-ratio, which decreased from 7.0–1.4 as enzyme dosage increased from 2 to 10 cost units per g substrate, showing that the incentive for introducing PEG to the process becomes stronger as the enzyme dosage increases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus is a species of great agronomic potential due to its growth-promotion traits. Its colonization process in different plants has been reported. However, there have been no studies regarding its structural colonization in elephant grass. This is a fast-growing C4-Poaceae plant, and its application in Brazil is mainly aimed at feeding dairy cattle, due to its high nutritional value. Also, in the last decade, this grass has been applied in the production of biofuels. The present study aimed to monitor the colonization process of strain LP343 of G. diazotrophicus inoculated in elephant grass seedlings of PCEA genotype, by using a mCherry-tagged bacterium. Samples of roots and shoots collected at different periods were visualized by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The colony-counting assay was used to compare the number of cells recovered in different niches and a qPCR was performed for the quantification of endophytic cells in root and shoot tissues. Results suggested that the strain LP343 quickly recognized the PCEA roots as host, attached to the elephant grass roots at 6 h, and 7 days after inoculation were able to colonize the xylem vessels of roots and shoots of elephant grass. This study advances our knowledge about the colonization process of G. diazotrophicus species in elephant grass, contributing to future studies involving the plant-bacteria interaction cultivated under gnotobiotic conditions. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Ethanol produced from renewable biomass, such as lignocellulosic feedstock, is one of the most promising future biofuels. In this paper, rapeseed straw was tested as an abundant and cost-effective renewable resource material for the production of cellulosic glucose. Pre-treatment of this material is an important step to improve the efficiency of subsequent cellulose hydrolysis. In this study, we used two pre-treatment methods – hydrothermochemical and ultrasound. Studies have shown that, in the initial hydrothermal pre-treatment of rapeseed straw, Al2(SO4)3 may be used as an efficient catalyst, at least in procedures for obtaining glucose. An increase in the amount of this catalyst was accompanied by higher yields of both furfural and glucose. Additional pre-treatment of lignocellulosic residue with ultrasound resulted in considerable improvements in the results from further enzymatic hydrolysis. The application of two enzymes at the hydrolysis stage also increased the amount of glucose obtained. It was shown that the additional use of ultrasound increased the glucose amount by 21–29 % after enzymatic hydrolysis with two types of enzymes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulose is a promising feedstock for butanol production owing to its abundance and renewability, however, most solventogenic clostridia could not directly convert these low-cost resources. Fermentable sugars could only be produced through pretreatment and hydrolysis processes, but furan and phenolic derivatives occurring in the lignocellulosic hydrolysate would inhibit cells’ growth and final butanol production capability. Compared to reported solventogenic Clostridia, the newly isolated Clostridium sp. strain LJ4 possessed high tolerance towards furan derivatives. Genes of sdr4, sdr1, akr, fmn and ad2 in strain LJ4 may play key roles in the bioconversion of furan derivatives based on the transcriptional levels’ analysis. As the phenolic derivatives containing in the undetoxified corncob hydrolysate were higher than the limited tolerance of strain LJ4, an electrochemical detoxification method was accordingly adopted to reduce the toxicity of phenolic derivatives without the loss of reducing sugars and generation of by-products. After 24 h detoxification of acid treated corncob hydrolysate, the phenolic compounds were decreased by nearly 40%, and 4.7 g/L of butanol was finally produced by strain LJ4 with 1.6-fold improvement than that from the un-detoxified corncob hydrolysate. Electrochemical technique could become a promising approach for biofuels or biochemicals production from undetoxified lignocellulosic hydrolysate owing to its high removal efficiency of phenolic derivatives without sugar loss. © 2020

AB  - Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are starting materials for the production of biolipid-based fuels such as biodiesel and biojet fuel. While various microorganisms can produce TAGs from renewable resources, the cultivation of TAG-producing microorganisms under sterilization conditions to avoid microbial contamination and application of solvent to extract TAGs from the TAG-filled microorganisms are costly. To overcome these challenges, this study reports the feasibility of a non-sterile cultivation of an oleaginous bacterium Rhodococcus opacus PD631SpAHB under saline conditions, followed by the use of a solvent-free, phage-lysis-protein-based bioextraction approach for TAGs release. The engineered strain PD631SpAHB was developed by introducing a recombinant plasmid carrying a phage lytic gene cassette (pAHB) into Rhodococcus opacus PD631 via transformation, followed by adaptive evolution under saline conditions. This newly developed strain is a salt-tolerant strain with the inducible plasmid pAHB to enable TAGs release into the supernatant upon induction. Cell lysis of PD631SpAHB was confirmed by the decrease of the optical density of cell suspension, by the loss of cell membrane integrity, and by the detection of TAGs in the culture medium. Up to 38% of the total TAGs accumulated in PD631SpAHB was released into supernatant after the expression of the lytic genes. PD631SpAHB strain is a promising candidate to produce TAGs from non-sterile growth medium and release of its TAGs without solvent extraction - a new approach to reduce the overall cost of biolipid-based biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study reports the development of an abiotic glucose indicator system constructed using a biofuel cell consisting of a colloidal platinum coated gold microwire (Au-co-Pt) anode and a platinum coated gas diffusion electrode (GDE). The electrochemical and polarization characterizations were achieved via cyclic voltammetry and current-voltage measurements. The biofuel cell demonstrated a maximum open circuit voltage ( Voc ) of 0.38 V and an Isc of 0.225 mA/cm2 with Pmax of 0.022 mW/cm2 when operating in 5 mM concentration. An optical readout circuit comprising a light emitting diode (LED) and an android mobile phone camera application (App.) were integrated to record glucose concentration levels correlating to the blinking frequency of the LED and transmit the recorded data to a smart phone in real time. When operated as a glucose indicator, the system exhibited a good sensitivity of 0.616μA mM-1 and linear dependence with a correlation coefficient of 0.995 and a wide linear dynamic range up to 50 mM. Excellent selectivity towards glucose in the presence of competing and interfering species was demonstrated. The fabricated abiotic glucose indicator system has the potential to serve as a potentiostat-less platform in point-of-care applications. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Lignin is a key target for modifying lignocellulosic biomass for efficient biofuel production. Brown midrib 12 (bmr12) encodes the sorghum caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and is one of the key enzymes in monolignol biosynthesis. Loss of function mutations in COMT reduces syringyl (S) lignin subunits and improves biofuel conversion rate. Although lignin plays an important role in maintaining cell wall integrity of xylem vessels, physiological and molecular consequences due to loss of COMT on root growth and adaptation to water deficit remain unexplored. We addressed this gap by evaluating the root morphology, anatomy and transcriptome of bmr12 mutant. The mutant had reduced lateral root density (LRD) and altered root anatomy and response to water limitation. The wild-type exhibits similar phenotypes under water stress, suggesting that bmr12 may be in a water deficit responsive state even in well-watered conditions. bmr12 had increased transcript abundance of genes involved in (a)biotic stress response, gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis and signaling. We show that bmr12 is more sensitive to exogenous GA application and present evidence for the role of GA in regulating reduced LRD in bmr12. These findings elucidate the phenotypic and molecular consequences of COMT deficiency under optimal and water stress environments in grasses. © 2020 No claim to US Government works New Phytologist ©2020 New Phytologist Foundation

AB  - Ceiba pentandra, non-edible oil (acid value of 21 mg KOH/g estimated using ASTM D664 methodology) is employed as a source for producing biodiesel using lipase immobilized on mesoporous material as a catalyst. Optimum conditions for maximum yield (96.4%) were the temperature of 33 °C, methanol to oil molar ratio of about 13.3:1 with a water content of 14.5%. From the reusability studies, it can be observed that greater than 85% conversion could be obtained up to 10 cycles, thereby proving the significant efficacy of the catalyst. Density, flash point, cloud point, calorific value, and cetane number of the produced biodiesels were 885 kg/m3, 152 °C, −3 °C, 38.44 kJ/kg and 57.2, respectively meeting the ASTM standards specified for biodiesel. The performance and emissions characteristics of 20% biodiesel (CIB20) and petroleum diesel were studied in a VCR under varying speeds in a full load condition. Blended biofuel showed a 13% lower mean brake power (BP) and 25% higher mean specific fuel consumption (SFC) compared to diesel fuel. Though NOx emission of the blended diesel was 31% higher than that of petroleum diesel, Hydrocarbon, CO2, and CO emissions were 8.4%, 13.7%, and 5.08% lower than that of diesel fuel, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel biosynthesis with enzymatic transesterification is considered green, sustainable, and environmentally friendly method. Lipase from Burkholderia cepacia G63 has excellent catalytic properties in biodiesel production. Lipase chaperones promote secretion and folding of enzymes, thereby enhancing enzymatic activity. In the current study, heterologous co-expression of lipase (lipA) and chaperone (lipB) was achieved in Escherichia coli through codon optimization. The enzymatic activity of purified and renatured lipAB was 2080.23 ± 19.18 U/g at 50 °C and pH 8.0. Moreover, lipAB showed increased resistance to pH and temperature changes, and lipAB retained stable catalytic properties after treatment with metal ions, organic solvents, and surfactants, namely Mg2+, methanol, and Triton-100X. Besides, using recombinant lipase lipAB as catalysts, biodiesel was synthesized using rapeseed oil under 50 °C for 72 h with a yield of 90.23%. Thus, the current study confirmed that co-expression of lipase and its chaperone is an effective strategy to enhance enzyme activity and improve the biochemical profile, meanwhile, showing that lipAB is a promising biocatalyst for biodiesel production. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As the by-products of edible oil production with rich lignin, the reserves of Camellia oleifera shell were abundant and had a great economic value. Lignin was the most important limiting factor during the conversion of plant biomass to pulp or biofuels, which mainly deposited in the stone cells of C. oleifera shells. Thus, its lignin deposition made the function of stone cells in the ripening process of the shell clearer, and provided a theoretical basis for the potential utilization of the biomass of C. oleifera shells. In this study, the paraffin embedding method was used to investigate the development and difference of stone cell in the fruitlet. The lignin deposition characteristics of stone cell were analyzed by the fluorescence microscopy and Wiesner and Mäule method. The chemical-functional group types of lignin in the stone cell of C. oleifera shell were examined by the ultraviolet spectrophotometer and transform infrared spectroscopy. The stone cells, vessels, parenchyma, and vascular tissue had existed during the young fruit growing period. The anatomical characteristics and the cell tissue ratio inverse relationship between stone cell and parenchymal cell suggested that stone cells developed from parenchymal cells. With the growth of shell, the stone cell wall thickened, and thickness-to-cavity ratio from 0 to 3.6. The fluorescent results showed that lignin content increased continuously; during shell development, the mean brightness of stone cell wall from 0 to 77.9 sections was stained with phloroglucinol-HCl, and Mäule revealed the presence of G-S-lignin in stone cells, and ImageJ results showed that G-lignin was distributed in the entire stone cell wall, while S-lignin deposition accounted for 48.59% of the cell wall area. In the FTIR spectra, the shell was identified as containing G-S-lignin. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Second-generation biofuels prove to be a distinctive and renewable source of sustainable energy and cleaner environment. The current study focuses on the exploration and identification of four nonedible sources, that is, Brassica oleracea L., Carthamus oxyacantha M.Bieb., Carthamus tinctorius L., and Beaumontia grandiflora Wall., utilizing light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for studying the detailed micromorphological features of these seeds. LM revealed that size ranges from 3 to 20 mm. furthermore, a great variety of color is observed from pitch black to greenish gray and yellowish white to off white. Seeds ultrastructure study with the help of SEM revealed a great variety in shape, size, color, sculpturing and periclinal wall shape, and so on. Followed by the production of fatty acid methyl esters from a novel source, that is, seeds oil of Brassica oleracea L. (seed oil content 42.20%, FFA content 0.329 mg KOH/g) using triple metal impregnated montmorillonite clay catalyst (Cu-Mg-Zn-Mmt). Catalyst was characterized using SEM–EDX, FT-IR. Maximum yield of Brassica oleracea L. biodiesel (87%) was obtained at the conditions; 1:9 of oil to methanol ratio, 0.5 g of catalyst, 5 hr reaction time, and 90°C of temperature. Synthesized biodiesel was characterized by FT-IR, GC–MS, and NMR. Fuel properties of the Brassica oleracea L. FAMES were determined and found in accordance with ASTM standards. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The present study describes the cloning of the cellobiohydrolase gene from a thermophilic bacteriumClostridium clariflavumand its expression inEscherichia coliBL21(DE3) utilizing the expression vector pET-21a(+). The optimization of various parameters (pH, temperature, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) concentration, time of induction) was carried out to obtain the maximum enzyme activity (2.78 ± 0.145 U ml−1) of recombinant enzyme. The maximum expression of recombinant cellobiohydrolase was obtained at pH 6.0 and 70 °C respectively. Enzyme purification was performed by heat treatment and immobilized metal anionic chromatography. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 57.4 U mg−1with 35.17% recovery and 3.90 purification fold. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed that the molecular weight of cellobiohydrolase was 78 kDa. Among metal ions, Ca2+showed a positive impact on the cellobiohydrolase enzyme with increased activity by 115%. Recombinant purified cellobiohydrolase enzyme remained stable and exhibited 77% and 63% residual activity in comparison to control in the presence ofn-butanol and after incubation at 80 °C for 1 h, respectively. Our results indicate that our purified recombinant cellobiohydrolase can be used in the biofuel industry. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) is a prominent option for second-generation biofuels production. Cellulase hydrolyses cellulose, a component of LCB by attacking the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, thus liberating mono, di, and oligosaccharides, which subsequently, can be converted to biofuel. In this study, a novel cellulase (Cel-3.1) of 1593 bp which encodes a 530 amino acid protein was identified from buffalo rumen metagenomic fosmid library, and functional expression was achieved through transformation into Escherichia coli. The molecular weight was estimated as 58 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Cel-3.1 belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family-5 (GH-5) and is predicted to have 14 α-helices and 15 β-strands. The optimal temperature and pH for Cel-3.1 were experimentally determined as 5.0 and 50 °C respectively. The synergistic effect of Ca2+ with K+ ions improved Cel-3.1 activity significantly (25%) and 1% Polyethylene Glycol (PEG-400), 1% β-mercaptoethanol enhanced the relative activity Cel-3.1 by 31.68%, 12.03% respectively. Further, the enzymatic (Cel-3.1) hydrolysis of pretreated rice straw and corncob released 13.41 ± 0.26 mg/mL and 15.04 ± 0.08 mg/mL reducing sugars respectively. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Fourier Transformation Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed the capability of Cel-3.1 for the breakdown and hydrolysis of both rice straw and corncob to generate various fermentable sugars. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Single-atom biological catalysts have attracted enormous attentions for low cost, high stability and catalytic activity in therapeutics and biomedical devices. The properties of Fe atom substituted CaII in HAP surface (Fe@HAP) and Fe adsorbed over HAP surface (Fe/HAP), and the detailed kinetic and thermodynamic behaviors of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) processes have been investigated by using the first-principles study. It is found that Fe dopant by substituted CaII ion into HAP surface could be more stably anchored at HAP surface than Fe adsorbate, and the introduced Fe dopant can enormously increase the endogenous ORR catalytic activity of magnetic HAP catalysts. Furthermore, the ORR process on Fe@HAP prefers to the 4e- pathway with the small reaction barrier (0.73 eV) for the rate-limiting step, and the two OH species formed from the hydrogenation of the adsorbed O2 prefer to further hydrogenate into two H2O molecules and their self-dehydrogenation is not preferable according to the transition states simulation, which is also confirmed by the Gibbs free energy calculation. Consequently, our results revealed that the Fe@HAP could be an efficient catalyst as cathode material in the applications of the implantable biofuel cells and shed light on the design of biomaterials for various applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass conversion using cellulases/polygalacturonases is a process that can be progressively influenced by several determinants involved in cellulose microfibril degradation. This article focuses on the kinetics and thermodynamics of thermal inactivation of recombinant Escherichia coli cellulases, cel12B, cel8C and a polygalacturonase, peh 28, derived from Pectobacterium carotovorum sub sp. carotovorum. Several consensus motifs conferring the enzymes' thermal stability in both cel12B and peh28 model structures have been detailed earlier, which were confirmed for the three enzymes through the current study of their thermal inactivation profiles over the 20-80°C range using the respective activities on carboxymethylcellulose and polygalacturonic acid. Kinetic constants and half-lives of thermal inactivation, inactivation energy, plus inactivation entropies, enthalpies and Gibbs free energies, revealed high stability, less conformational change and protein unfolding for cel12B and peh28 due to thermal denaturation compared to cel8C. The apparent thermal stability of peh28 and cel12B, along with their hydrolytic efficiency on a lignocellulosic biomass conversion as reported previously, makes these enzymes candidates for various industrial applications. Analysis of the Gibbs free energy values suggests that the thermal stabilities of cel12B and peh28 are entropy-controlled over the tested temperature range. © The Author(s) 2020.

Next to the traditional wood-derived fuels, the advancement of biomass upgrading technologies like steam explosion (SE), followed by pelleting, further broadens the variety of materials on the market. This thermochemical and mechanical upgrading improves greatly the general properties of such fuels (homogeneity, energy density, water resistance, biological decomposition, grindability, pneumatic transport, etc.) and at the same time offers the possibility for co-production of green chemicals/biorefinery processing. However, these alternative SE-material pellets have different properties from the fossil counterparts with regard to dust formation, dielectric, ignitability, and explosive characteristics, hence posing an increased risk of fire and explosion in handling, transport, and storage of the biosolid fuels. These divergent properties need to be properly addressed before their large implementation in the industry. To shed more light on the variability of such material properties, several batches of SE pellets varying in bulk density and subjected to different handling and storage conditions were evaluated. This was done using a number of standardized equipment and following industrial standard measurement methodologies to compare steam-exploded material with standard white wood pellets and reference coals. The main body of the work focused on the explosivity of dust generated in the handling of the pellets, studied using a Hartmann tube, coupled with a high-speed camera to evaluate the sensitivity [minimum ignition energy (MIE) and minimum explosive concentration (MEC)] and the severity maximum flame front velocity (FFVmax) of explosions of the generated SE-pellet dust. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) was used to measure and compare the ignitability of dust layers of SE-pellet dust vs coal and as a function of co-mixture. Finally, the SE-pellet self-heating behavior was addressed using the standard "basket method"and compared with that of a commercial coal sample. The results show that the SE pellets produce very low levels of dust even after extensive weathering, hence limiting the explosion potential. The MIE and MEC of SE-pellet dusts exhibited similar values compared to those of the parent raw biomass material; however, the FFVmax revealed lower values when compared to that of the parent raw biomass. Also, the self-heating propensity is very low as the pellets are basically immune to biological degradation, while the spontaneous ignition temperature is high and in the range of nonhazardous bulk materials. ©

AB  - 2-Oxoglutarate carboxylase (OGC), a unique member of the biotin-dependent carboxylase family from the order Aquificales, captures dissolved CO2 via the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. Structure and function studies of OGC may facilitate adaptation of the rTCA cycle to increase the level of carbon fixation for biofuel production. Here we compare the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus OGC with the well-studied mesophilic homologues to identify features that may contribute to thermal stability and activity. We report three OGC BC X-ray structures, each bound to bicarbonate, ADP, or ADP-Mg2+, and propose that substrate binding at high temperatures is facilitated by interactions that stabilize the flexible subdomain B in a partially closed conformation. Kinetic measurements with varying ATP and biotin concentrations distinguish two temperature-dependent steps, consistent with biotin's rate-limiting role in organizing the active site. Transition state thermodynamic values derived from the Eyring equation indicate a larger positive ΔH± and a less negative Δ+ compared to those of a previously reported mesophilic homologue. These thermodynamic values are explained by partially rate limiting product release. Phylogenetic analysis of BC domains suggests that OGC diverged prior to Aquificales evolution. The phylogenetic tree identifies mis-annotations of the Aquificales BC sequences, including the Aquifex aeolicus pyruvate carboxylase structure. Notably, our structural data reveal that the OGC BC dimer comprises a "wet"dimerization interface that is dominated by hydrophilic interactions and structural water molecules common to all BC domains and likely facilitates the conformational changes associated with the catalytic cycle. Mutations in the dimerization domain demonstrate that dimerization contributes to thermal stability. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Triacylglycerol Lipases (TGLs) are the major enzymes involved in triacylglycerol catabolism. TGLs hydrolyze long-chain fatty acid triglycerides, which are involved in plant development and abiotic stress responses. Whereas most studies of TGLs have focused on seed oil metabolism and biofuel in plants, limited information is available regarding the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TGL gene family in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Based on the latest published tomato genome annotation ITAG4.0, 129 SlTGL genes were identified and classified into 5 categories according to their structural characteristics. Most SlTGL genes were distributed on 3 of 12 chromosomes. Segment duplication appeared to be the driving force underlying expansion of the TGL gene family in tomato. The promoter analysis revealed that the promoters of SlTGLs contained many stress responsiveness cis-elements, such as ARE, LTR, MBS, WRE3, and WUN-motifs. Expression of the majority of SlTGL genes was suppressed following exposure to chilling and heat, while it was induced under drought stress, such as SlTGLa9, SlTGLa6, SlTGLa25, SlTGLa26, and SlTGLa13. These results provide valuable insights into the roles of the SlTGL genes family and lay a foundation for further functional studies on the linkage between triacylglycerol catabolism and abiotic stress responses in tomato. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - New industrial microorganisms are required to improve biofuel production with a key factor being ethanol fermentation at a high temperature. In this study, 222 yeast isolates from sugarcane field soil from lower Northern Thailand were isolated using yeast extract peptone dextrose medium supplemented with 4% (v/v) ethanol. The isolates were characterized for growth performance under stress conditions and for fermentation activity at high temperatures. A phylogenetic analysis of 25 thermotolerant yeasts grouped the isolates into clusters of Candida blankii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia kudriavzevii. Two isolates, P. kudriavzevii NUPHS33 and NUPHS34, exhibited high temperature and ethanol tolerance levels of up to 45°C and 15 (v/v), respectively. Ethanol production upon utilization of glucose as a carbon source was determined by gas chromatography. The highest ethanol concentration of P. kudriavzevii NUPHS33 and NUPHS34 reached 61.51±1.01 g/l at 45°C and 69.79±1.54 g/l at 40°C, respectively, which is significantly greater than the amount of ethanol produced by the industrial strain S. cerevisiae TISTR5606 (p < 0.01). Therefore, the newly isolated thermo- and ethanol-tolerant P. kudriavzevii NUPHS33 and NUPHS34 are highly competent yeasts for high-temperature ethanol fermentation. Our results might be useful to further improve commercial-scale bioethanol production. © 2021 Science Society of Thailand under Royal Patronage. All rights reserved.

AB  - Brewer’s spent grain (BSG) is the main by-product of the beer brewing process. It has a huge potential as a feedstock for bio-based manufacturing processes to produce high-value bioproducts, biofuels, and platform chemicals. For the valorisation of BSG in a biorefinery process, efficient fractionation and bio-conversion processes are required. The aim of our study was to develop a novel fractionation of BSG for the production of arabinose, arabino-xylooligomers, xylose, and bioethanol. A fractionation process including two-step acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis steps was investigated and optimised by a response surface methodology and a desirability function approach to fractionate the carbohydrate content of BSG. In the first acidic hydrolysis, high arabinose yield (76%) was achieved under the optimised conditions (90◦C, 1.85 w/w% sulphuric acid, 19.5 min) and an arabinose-and arabino-xylooligomer-rich supernatant was obtained. In the second acidic hydrolysis, the remaining xylan was solubilised (90% xylose yield) resulting in a xylose-rich hydrolysate. The last, enzymatic hydrolysis step resulted in a glucose-rich supernatant (46 g/L) under optimised conditions (15 w/w% solids loading, 0.04 g/g enzyme dosage). The glucose-rich fraction was successfully used for bioethanol production (72% ethanol yield by commercial baker’s yeast). The developed and optimised process offers an efficient way for the value-added utilisation of BSG. Based on the validated models, the amounts of the produced sugars, the composition of the sugar streams and solubilised oligo-saccharides are predictable and variable by changing the reaction conditions of the process. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Glycerol is a readily available and inexpensive substance that is mostly generated during biofuel production processes. In order to ensure the viability of the biofuel industry, it is essential to develop complementing technologies for the resource utilization of glycerol. Ethylene glycol is a two-carbon organic chemical with multiple applications and a huge market. In this study, an artificial enzymatic cascade comprised alditol oxidase, catalase, glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase, pyruvate decarboxylase and lactaldehyde:propanediol oxidoreductase was developed for the production of ethylene glycol from glycerol. The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) generated during the dehydrogenation of the glycerol oxidation product D-glycerate can be as the reductant to support the ethylene glycol production. Using this in vitro synthetic system with self-sufficient NADH recycling, 7.64 ± 0.15 mM ethylene glycol was produced from 10 mM glycerol in 10 h, with a high yield of 0.515 ± 0.1 g/g. The in vitro enzymatic cascade is not only a promising alternative for the generation of ethylene glycol but also a successful example of the value-added utilization of glycerol. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Co-consumption of D-xylose and D-glucose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is essential for cost-efficient cellulosic bioethanol production. There is a need for improved sugar conversion rates to minimize fermentation times. Previously, we have employed evolutionary engineering to enhance D-xylose transport and metabolism in the presence of D-glucose in a xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae strain devoid of hexokinases. Re-introduction of Hxk2 in the high performance xylose-consuming strains restored D-glucose utilization during D-xylose/D-glucose co-metabolism, but at rates lower than the non-evolved strain. In the absence of D-xylose, D-glucose consumption was similar to the parental strain. The evolved strains accumulated trehalose-6-phosphate during sugar co-metabolism, and showed an increased expression of trehalose pathway genes. Upon the deletion of TSL1, trehalose-6-phosphate levels were decreased and D-glucose consumption and growth on mixed sugars was improved. The data suggest that D-glucose/D-xylose co-consumption in high-performance D-xylose consuming strains causes the glycolytic flux to saturate. Excess D-glucose is phosphorylated enters the trehalose pathway resulting in glucose recycling and energy dissipation, accumulation of trehalose-6-phosphate which inhibits the hexokinase activity, and release of trehalose into the medium. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Ionic liquids, such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Emim]Cl), have immense applicability as solvents in different industrial settings including lignocellulosic biofuel production. However, these solvents are toxic to most organisms. Moderate halophiles are an established microbial group that can tolerate [Emim]Cl by employing their general salt-tolerant mechanisms. Anticipating future exposure of [Emim]Cl to natural environments, the present study was designed to evaluate bacterial community structure in slightly saline (20 g L−1 or 2%) sediments of Sambhar Salt Lake, Rajasthan, India, after microcosm enrichment with [Emim]Cl. The sediment used does not have any native [Emim]Cl (100 mM)–tolerant bacteria. However, after a two-step enrichment of 25 days each with 0.5 M and 1.0 M [Emim]Cl, the tolerant colonies increased to 54.9% and 93.0%, respectively. But in similar NaCl enrichment, or control incubations, such colonies were absent. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence-based alpha diversity in 50 days [Emim]Cl-enriched set was lower than the initial, control and NaCl-enriched sets (Shannon index of 6.71 vs. 8.0–8.26, respectively). Even its bacterial community structure was distinct from the remaining three sets, which clustered together. [Emim]Cl-enriched set has almost fourfold higher abundance of Proteobacteria (50.36%), with Gammaproteobacteria (32.25%) and particularly Enterobacteriaceae (24.19%) members being predominant with a predicted higher abundance of membrane transporters. Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were most sensitive groups to [Emim]Cl enrichment. Although moderate halophiles can utilise their general NaCl tolerance mechanisms to resist toxicity of [Emim]Cl, abrupt exposure of the later disturbs microbial population structure and thus demands their meticulous use avoiding environmental contamination. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Researchers debate the viability of biofuels to address growing global energy demands and climate change. Understanding factors that maintain and build public support for government policies bolstering biofuels is critical. Using a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine the influence of competing cost arguments and spatial variation in ZIP-code level gasoline prices on Americans' support for federal tax credits to promote biofuels. We examine the influence of competing arguments about the cost implications of biofuels for consumers on support for federal tax credits, and whether such treatment effects are moderated by respondents’ political partisanship and by variation in local fuel prices. Consistent with research on loss aversion, arguments that biofuels could increase costs for consumers were more influential than arguments touting economic benefits. However, arguments that biofuels could eventually decrease fuel costs for consumers were more influential among subjects who experienced high local gasoline prices. Finally, we found evidence of a significant partisan divide in policy preferences, and evidence that partisanship moderates the influence both of competing cost frames and of local fuel prices on support for federal biofuels tax credits. Our results add important nuance to understanding of how economic calculations affect public support for policies to support biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sequential pretreatments for sugarcane bagasse (scb) by NaOH followed by organosolv under mild conditions were evaluated for cellulose recovery and dilignification. The best-optimized sequential pretreatment of scb was obtained at 10% (w/v) of raw scb loading at 1% (w/v) NaOH (50 °C, 2 h) followed by treatment with organosolv (85%, v/v phosphoric acid, 50 °C, 1 h) with chilled acetone. This sequentially pretreated scb showed cellulose recovery, 66.1% (w/w) and delignification, 83.2% (w/w). NaOH or organosolv pretreated scb showed lower cellulose recovery 47.4% (w/w) or 54.5% (w/w) with lower delignification, 61% (w/w) or 56% (w/w), respectively. Pretreated solid residue of sequentially pretreated scb was enzymatically saccharified by chimera (β-glucosidase and endoglucanase, CtGH1-L1-CtGH5-F194A) and cellobiohydrolase (CtCBH5A) cloned from Clostridium thermocellum. Enzymatic hydrolysate of best sequentially pretreated scb gave total reducing sugar (TRS) yield, 230 mg/g and glucose yield, 137 mg/g pretreated scb. Only organosolv pretreated scb gave TRS yield, 112.5 mg/g and glucose yield, 72 mg/g of pretreated scb. Thus, sequentially pretreated scb resulted in 37% higher enzymatic digestibility than only orgnaosolv pretreated scb. Higher enzymatic digestibility was supported by higher crystallinity index CrI (45%) than those obtained with only organosolv pretreated (38%) or raw scb (25%). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses showed enhanced cellulose exposure in sequentially pretreated scb. Preliminary investigation of bioethanol production at small scale by separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) of enzymatic hydrolysate from best sequentially pretreated scb by Saccharomyces cerevisiae gave maximum ethanol yield of 0.42 g/g of glucose. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - Abstract: Endoglucanases are key elements in several industrial applications, such as cellulosic biomass hydrolysis, cellulose fiber modification for the production paper and composite materials, and in nanocellulose production. In all of these applications, the desired function of the endoglucanase is to create nicks in the amorphous regions of the cellulose. However, endoglucanase can be diverted from its activity on the fibers by other substrates—soluble oligosaccharides. This issue was addressed in the current study using enzyme engineering and an enzyme evolution approach. To this end, a hypothetical endoglucanase from a thermostable bacterium Spirochaeta thermophila was for the first time cloned and characterized. The wild-type enzyme was used as a starting point for mutagenesis and molecular evolution toward a preference for the higher molecular weight substrates. The best of the evolved enzymes was more active than the wild-type enzyme toward high molecular weight substrate at temperatures below 45 °C (3-fold more active at 30 °C) and showed little or no activity with low molecular weight substrates. These findings can be instrumental in bioeconomy sectors, such as second-generation biofuels and biomaterials from lignocellulosic biomass. Key points: • A new thermostable endoglucanase was characterized. • The substrate specificity of this endoglucanase was changed by means of genetic engineering. • A mutant with a preference for long molecular weight substrate was obtained and proposed to be beneficial for cellulose fiber modification. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A range of energy fuels (ethanol, char, oil/wax and gas) was produced from fibre waste contaminated with plastic through the application of a fermentation-pyrolysis route. The fibre component was first converted to ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), achieving an ethanol concentration of 39.8 g/L. The residue, enriched in lignin and plastics, was subjected to fast pyrolysis at temperatures between 350 and 550 °C. A wax product with a higher heating value (HHV) higher than 28 MJ/kg was obtained for temperatures higher than 450 °C, while values lower than 15 MJ/kg were observed for the oils produced from the untreated waste stream. Pyrolysis at 550 °C produced a wax with an HHV as high as 32.1 MJ/kg, where 51.8% of the energy content of the fermentation residue was transferred. The attractive energy contents of the pyrolysis products were enabled by oxygen removal from the feedstock during fermentation to ethanol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to evaluate the effect of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) heterogeneity and hydrothermal (HT) pretreatment on biofuels production, industrial and laboratorial, rind and pith, hydrothermally pretreated (200 °C for 10 min at 16 bar and 10 g of SCB mixed with 100 mL of water) and untreated sugarcane bagasse (SCB) were used as substrate (10 g/L) in batch reactors at thermophilic condition (55 °C) and initial pH of 6.0. High cellulose content in the hydrothermally (HT) pretreated sugarcane bagasse (SCB) results in hydrogen production (33.7 mmol/L), while lactic acid was the main metabolite produced using laboratorial untreated SCB rind and pith (1.5 and 1.3 g/L, respectively), which caused a decrease in the pH and no hydrogen production. Methane was only observed when industrial untreated SCB pith and rind (5.5 and 3.1 mmol/L), respectively, was used. 16S rRNA sequencing was carried out and at the end of the operation the reactors were fed with untreated laboratorial rind, hydrothermally pretreated industrial rind and untreated industrial pith. Hydrogen-producing bacteria, such as Acetomicrobium (74.4 %) was favored using the HT pretreated fiber, while lactic acid bacteria such as Lactococcus (6.3 %) had a potentially negative effect on the hydrogen-producing bacteria like Thermoanaerobacterium (75.0 %) using laboratorial untreated SCB, since no hydrogen was obtained in this condition. Microorganisms involved in all the anaerobic digestion steps, such as Clostridium (34.4 %), Acetomicrobium (33.4 %), and Methanoculleus (14.8 %) lead to hydrogen, volatile fatty acids (VFA), ethanol, and methane production using industrial untreated SCB. Therefore, this study successfully dissected the detailed microbial community structure and the shift on metabolic pathways as a response of SCB heterogeneity and hydrothermal pretreatment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introducing biomass-derived additives into microalgae cultivation to increase its yield has been regarded as a more cost-effective and environment-friendly method compared with gene-editing and nutrients supplementation. In this research, feasibility of three major phenolic compounds from lignin's basic structures (guaiacyl-, hydroxyphenyl- and syringyl- types) for freshwater microalga Euglena gracilis cultivation was evaluated. The results indicated that trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (HMA), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (HBA), and syringaldehyde (SRA) could all promote microalgae growth in a phytohormone-like role, and the highest promotion effect was achieved under HMA treatment. HMA at 0.5 g·L−1 enhanced the cell biomass yield by 2.30 times, while HBA and SRA at the concentration of 0.1 g·L−1 increased the yield by 1.30 and 1.21 times, respectively. In addition, increased carotenoids and lipid biosynthesis were also observed under the treatments of phenolic compounds, which would contribute to the microalgae biofuel production, since the growth and lipid accumulation of E. gracilis were simultaneously enhanced. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgal lipid triacylglycerol (TAG) is a promising source for sustainable production of biofuels and edible oils. TAG biosynthesis in microalgae can be induced by nitrogen starvation (−N); however, regulation of the genes involved in this process is poorly known. To explore the regulation of gene encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 of oleaginous microalga Neochloris oleoabundans (NeoDGAT2) responsible for TAG biosynthesis, regulatory sequence of NeoDGAT2 gene (RDG) was cloned, and its functional regions were mapped by deletion analysis using the modified cyan fluorescent protein gene (CFP) as a reporter. The efficiency of CFP gene mTurquoise2 (Tq) without any intron, Tq1 and Tq2 with one and two copies of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rbcS2 intron 1, respectively, was evaluated; Tq2 exhibited the highest CFP fluorescence activity in N. oleoabundans was therefore used as reporter for RDG deletion analysis. Deletion analysis of RDG revealed that the −N inducible region contained the predicted binding site of MYB transcription factor (MYB-bs). Specific binding between MYB-bs of RDG and the DNA-binding domain of MYB-related transcription factor ROC40 from C. reinhardtii was observed using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Therefore, the corresponding MYB transcription factor in N. oleoabundans is probably the transcription factor regulating NeoDGAT2. The interaction between MYB transcription factor and the MYB-bs may play a role in regulating −N induced expression of NeoDGAT2, affecting TAG accumulation. MYB transcription factors can be the potential targets for engineering to increase TAG content. Increasing TAG content is essential for products derived from microalgal TAG to achieve economic viability. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The rapid growth of industries and large number of population are considered to be the major two factors that contribute to the crisis of global energy. Biofuels are considered to be the best replacement of the energy produced from the nonrenewable fossil fuels. The use of mature technologies depicts a sear need of biomasses that it causes a competition with the food chain in case of the first generation of Bioethanol. This disadvantage was overcome by the second generation bioethanol where lignocellulosic biomass is the raw material. Algal biomass from marine environment has also gained a lot of importance in third and fourth generation of raw material for biofuel production. The main challenge arrived when scaling up became the biggest problem in the process of bioethanol production. This review mainly aims to focus on the challenges faced in the commercialization of the biofuels. Many scientists are working majorly on economic processes so as to commercialize the biofuel production techniques. Some energy and cost effective distillation process has been described in this review article, which can help in the scaling up the process to an industrial level. Practical Applications: This review mainly aims to focus on the basic overview of the bioethanol production and the challenges faced in the commercialization of the biofuels. Many scientists around the globe are working majorly on economic processes so as to commercialize the biofuel production techniques. The review compiles the evolution of one generation biofuels from another by overcoming the disadvantages of the previous generation. This will help the young researchers to have a complete idea about significance of bioethanol production. In the present times, there are many less pollution causing and renewable natural resources that can produce bioethanol in the laboratory scale effectively. The main challenge is to produce bioethanol in large scale. Though this area for scale up technologies of the ethanol production is less explored, but there is immense scope of development and modification. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In the present study, valorization of food and lignocellulosic wastes into biodiesel and 2-phenylethanol using Metchinikowia pulcherrima isolated from rotten food wastes was evaluated. At the optimum pH of 5.5, food waste hydrolysate (FWH) showed 74.1% higher dry weight than the corresponding synthetic medium. Rice straw (RS) and softwood sawdust (WWA) were used as additional carbon sources to increase the C:N ratio of FWH. WWA enhanced the biomass production by 23.3% and 55.9% over the corresponding RS and FWH, respectively; while RS enhanced lipid accumulation. Due to enhancement of growth, 75 g WWA showed the maximum recorded lipid productivity of 2.49 g L−1 d−1. Interestingly, both hexoses and pentoses were effectively metabolized. Regarding fatty acid profile of M. pulcherrima, RS- and WWA-enriched growth media showed higher saturated fatty acids proportions (56.9% and 98.3%, respectively, over that of FWH), with better biodiesel characteristics. FWH showed the heights significant production of 2-phenylethanol up to 56.7 mg L−1 after 96 hours. However, FWH enriched with WWA showed the highest gross energy output of 33.98 GJ m−3 y−1. Thus, the present study suggested an integrated approach of M. pulcherrima cultivation on FWH enriched with WWA for efficient biofuel production through waste recycling. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - A total 42.68 g/L monosaccharide with 0.10 g/L HMF was obtained from 10% (w/v) Kappaphycus alvarezii with thermal acid hydrolysis using 350 mM HNO3 at 121 °C for 60 min and enzymatic saccharification with a 1:1 mixture of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5 L for 72 h. To enhance the galactose utilization rate, fermentation was performed with overexpression of GAL1 (galactokinase), GAL7 (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase), GAL10 (UDP-glucose-4-epimerase), and PGM2 (phosphoglucomutase 2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK2 using CCW12 as a strong promoter. Among the strains, the overexpression of PGM2 showed twofold high galactose utilization rate (URgal) and produced ethanol 1.4-fold more than that of the control. Transcriptional analysis revealed the increase of PGM2 transcription level leading to enhance glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate and plays a key role in ensuring a higher glycolytic flux in the PGM2 strain. This finding shows particular importance in biofuel production from seaweed because galactose is one of the major monosaccharides in seaweeds such as K. alvarezii. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Development of artificial enzymes, including nanozymes as an alternative for non-stable and expensive natural enzymes, is a booming field of modern Biosensorics and Biofuel Technology. In this study, we describe fabrication and characterization of sensitive biosensors for the detection of ethanol and glucose based on new micro/nanocomposite electrodes with peroxidase-like activity (nanozyme) coupled with microbial oxidases: alcohol oxidase (AOX) and glucose oxidase (GOX). The nanozyme was synthesized by modification of carbon microfibers (CF) by hemin (H) and gold (Au) nanoparticles. The formation of gold nanoparticles on the surface of hemin-modified carbon microfibers has been confirmed by the UV–Vis and X-ray spectroscopy as well by the SEM analysis. Compared to hemin-only modified electrodes, the resulting micro/nanocomposite CF-H-Au electrodes exhibit a higher specific catalytic activity and a better affinity for H2O2 in solution. The H2O2-sensitive CF-H-Au-modified electrodes showed a higher sensitivity (1.3–2.6-fold) compared with the nearest carbon-derived analogs and were used for the construction of highly sensitive ethanol and glucose biosensors. To eliminate diffusion limitation for substrates, AOX or GOX were fixed on the CF-H-Au-modified electrodes using a highly porous Nafion membrane. The main biosensors’ characteristics have been investigated. The developed biosensors were tested for ethanol and glucose analysis in the real samples of both grape must and wine. The results are in good agreement with the results obtained using enzymatic kits as reference approaches. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report on a photobioelectrochemical fuel cell consisting of a glucose-oxidase-modified BiFeO3 photobiocathode and a quantum-dot-sensitized inverse opal TiO2 photobioanode linked to FAD glucose dehydrogenase via a redox polymer. Both photobioelectrodes are driven by enzymatic glucose conversion. Whereas the photobioanode can collect electrons from sugar oxidation at rather low potential, the photobiocathode shows reduction currents at rather high potential. The electrodes can be arranged in a sandwich-like manner due to the semi-transparent nature of BiFeO3, which also guarantees a simultaneous excitation of the photobioanode when illuminated via the cathode side. This tandem cell can generate electricity under illumination and in the presence of glucose and provides an exceptionally high OCV of about 1 V. The developed semi-artificial system has significant implications for the integration of biocatalysts in photoactive entities for bioenergetic purposes, and it opens up a new path toward generation of electricity from sunlight and (bio)fuels. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Simulations enable fundamental electrochemistry to be more deeply understood and are useful tools for the further development of electrochemical processes. However, important parameter restrictions have thus far limited the applicability of electrochemical simulations. In this study, we developed a realistic model of mediator-type enzyme electrodes to accurately simulate cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy by considering the current arising from electrochemical double-layer charging. Implementation of the finite element method in these calculations resulted in a model with very few boundary conditions. The model was successfully tested for various enzyme and electrode reaction kinetics and subsequently adapted to describe immobilized enzymes and mediators. The insight gained through this study has implications for the further development of biosensor and biofuel cell technologies. © 2020

AB  - Alcohol toxicity significantly impacts the titer and productivity of industrially produced biofuels. To overcome this limitation, we must find and use strategies to improve stress tolerance in production strains. Previously, we developed a multiplex navigation of a global regulatory network (MINR) library that targeted 25 regulatory genes that are predicted to modify global regulation in yeast under different stress conditions. In this study, we expanded this concept to target the active sites of 47 transcriptional regulators using a saturation mutagenesis library. The 47 targeted regulators interact with more than half of all yeast genes. We then screened and selected for C3-C4 alcohol tolerance. We identified specific mutants that have resistance to isopropanol and isobutanol. Notably, the WAR1_K110N variant improved tolerance to both isopropanol and isobutanol. In addition, we investigated the mechanisms for improvement of isopropanol and isobutanol stress tolerance and found that genes related to glycolysis play a role in tolerance to isobutanol, while changes in ATP synthesis and mitochondrial respiration play a role in tolerance to both isobutanol and isopropanol. Overall, this work sheds light on basic mechanisms for isopropanol and isobutanol toxicity and demonstrates a promising strategy to improve tolerance to C3-C4 alcohols by perturbing the transcriptional regulatory network. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Although multicopper oxidase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (McoP) can be particularly useful in biotechnological applications, e.g., as a specific catalyst at the biocathode of biofuel cells (BFCs), owing to its high stability against extremely high temperatures and across a wide range of pH values, this application potential remains limited due to the enzyme's low catalytic activity. A directed evolution strategy was conducted to improve McoP catalytic activity, and the No. 571 mutant containing four amino acid substitutions was identified, with specific activity approximately 9-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme. Among the substitutions, the single amino acid mutant F290I was essential in enhancing catalytic activity, with a specific activity approximately 12-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme. F290I thermostability and pH stability were notably comparable with values obtained for the wild type. Crystal structure analysis suggested that the F290I mutant increased loop flexibility near the T1 Cu center, and affected electron transfer between the enzyme and substrate. Additionally, electric current density of the F290I mutant-immobilized electrode was 7-fold higher than that of the wild type-immobilized one. These results indicated that F290I mutant was a superior catalyst with potential in practical biotechnological applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Studies on microalgal lipid production as a sustainable feedstock for biofuels and chemicals are scarce, particularly those on applying open thin-layer cascade (TLC) photobioreactors under dynamic diurnal conditions. Continuous lipid production with Microchloropsis salina was studied in scalable TLC photobioreactors at 50 m2 pilot scale, applying a physically simulated Mediterranean summer climate. A cascade of two serially connected TLC reactors was applied, promoting biomass growth under nutrient-replete conditions in the first reactor, while inducing the accumulation of lipids via nitrogen limitation in the second reactor. Up to 4.1 g L−1 of lipids were continuously produced at productivities of up to 0.27 g L−1 d−1 (1.8 g m2 d−1 ) at a mean hydraulic residence time of 2.5 d in the first reactor and 20 d in the second reactor. Coupling mass balances with the kinetics of microalgal growth and lipid formation enabled the simulation of phototrophic process performances of M. salina in TLC reactors in batch and continuous operation at the climate conditions studied. This study demonstrates the scalability of continuous microalgal lipid production in TLC reactors with M. salina and provides a TLC reactor model for the realistic simulation of microalgae lipid production processes after re-identification of the model parameters if other microalgae and/or varying climate conditions are applied. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Micro-reactor (MR) technology is known as an alternative technique for producing materials in a more sustainable way. The advantages of micro-reactors and membrane separation which are combined in membrane micro-reactors (MMR) listed as improved heat and mass transfer, high surface area to volume ratio, enhanced catalytic efficiency with no equilibrium limitation, flexibility in reactor design, a short distance of molecular diffusion as well as high operational safety. The restriction of low production capacity of micro-reactors can be easily solved by using parallel micro-channels in a reactor chip. This mini-review represents firstly the definition of micro-reactors as well as the advantages and disadvantages of membrane micro-reactors. Furthermore, the theoretical basics of membrane micro-reactors and their fabrication methods are presented. At last, the application of catalytic membrane micro-reactors in different processes is given especially in biofuel production. The achieved results of previous researches for hydrogen and other fuels production show better performance of catalytic MMRs in terms of reaction conversion and coke deposition compared with convectional reactors at the same reaction conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study aims to produce a significant quantity of fermentable sugars from tubers sourced from northern Thailand to boost bioethanol production. Bioethanol production from Amorphophallus spp. tubers was compared using biological and chemical approaches. The tubers were sliced into small pieces (1–2 cm), dried in a solar oven, and powdered before hydrolyzing with cellulase enzymes. The results revealed the fermentable sugar content of Amorphophallus spp. tuber increased from 2.6 g/L–19.01 g/L after enzymatic hydrolysis. Furthermore, under the ideal condition, the total sugar concentration was 33.22 g/L. Enzymes help to speed up the hydrolysis process, and biological methods are also less expensive and more ecologically friendly than chemical equivalents. After the alcoholic fermentation, the highest ethanol content was obtained, 8.68 ± 0.91 g/L, using S. cerevisiae for 48 h. Konjac receives little attention in the biofuel industry due to its irritating nature to the mouth and throat when swallowed, implying that competition between the fuel and food sectors is lower than for other feedstocks such as cassava and corn. Improved fermentable sugars may be used in the near future for bioethanol production to address the worldwide issue of declining fossil fuel consumption. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Flavin-dependent glucose dehydrogenases (FAD-GDH) are oxygen-independent enzymes with high potential to be used as biocatalysts in glucose biosensing applications. Here, we present the construction of an amperometric biosensor and a biofuel cell device, which are based on a thermophilic variant of the enzyme originated from Talaromyces emersonii. The enzyme overexpression in Escherichia coli and its isolation and performance in terms of maximal bioelectrocatalytic currents were evaluated. We examined the biosensor's bioelectrocatalytic activity in 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol-, thionine-, and dichloro-naphthoquinone-mediated electron transfer configurations or in a direct electron transfer one. We showed a negligible interference effect and good stability for at least 20 h for the dichloro-naphthoquinone configuration. The constructed biosensor was also tested in interstitial fluid-like solutions to show high bioelectrocatalytic current responses. The bioanode was coupled with a bilirubin oxidase-based biocathode to generate 270 μW/cm2 in a biofuel cell device. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The co-cultivation of GRAS amylolytic bacteria together with ethanol-producing yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in starch-containing media might be one of the ways solving the problem of starch-containing waste disposal with simultaneous formation of ethanol as a potential biofuel for increasing octane number of gasoline. The aim of the study was to test the combination of microorganisms (amylolytic lactic acid bacteria and yeast) suitable for co-cultivation on starch and to optimize the conditions for starch co-fermentation. Methods. Conventional microbiological, biochemical and statistical methods, including serial dilution technique with counting colony forming units (CFU) for growth assessment of mixed cultures, Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) for measuring ethanol concentration and Box-Behnken experimental design (Statistica 10) for bioethanol production optimization, were used in this work. Results. The combination of microorganisms for mixed cultures co-cultivation in single-stage starch fermentation was established: the strain of ethanol-producing yeast S. cerevisiae UCM Y-527 and the amylolytic strain of lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus bovis IMV B-7151. Mathematical simulation using a Box-Behnken (3k-p) design determined the optimal parameters for the fermentation of starch in the process of co-cultivation of yeast and bacteria: 10 g/L of starch in the medium at simultaneous inoculations of both cultures and co-cultivation for 72 hours. The theoretically obtained parameters data were experimentally verified: the maximum ethanol yield 1.95 g/L in the experiment corresponded to the theoretically calculated values. Conclusions. It was suggested and optimized a method of starch co-fermentation using strains of amylolytic lactic acid bacteria S. bovis IMV B-7151 and yeast S. cerevisiae UCM Y-527, which can be used for one-stage process of hydrolysis and fermentation of starch and starch-containing wastes with the production of bioethanol and microbial biomass. © 2021, Zabolotny Institute of Microbiology and Virology, NAS of Ukraine.

AB  - Lignin is one of the main factors determining recalcitrance to processing of lignocellulosic biomass towards bio-based materials and fuels. Consequently, wood of plants engineered for low lignin content is typically more amenable to processing. However, lignin-modified plants often exhibit collapsed vessels and associated growth defects. Vessel-specific reintroduction of lignin biosynthesis in dwarfed low-lignin cinnamoyl-CoA reductase1 (ccr1) Arabidopsis mutants using the ProSNBE:AtCCR1 construct overcame the yield penalty while maintaining high saccharification yields, and showed that monolignols can be transported between the different xylem cells acting as ‘good neighbors’ in Arabidopsis. Here, we translated this research into the bio-energy crop poplar. By expressing ProSNBE:AtCCR1 into CRISPR/Cas9-generated ccr2 poplars, we aimed for vessel-specific lignin biosynthesis to: (i) achieve growth restoration while maintaining high saccharification yields; and (ii) study the existence of ‘good neighbors’ in poplar wood. Analyzing the resulting ccr2 ProSNBE:AtCCR1 poplars showed that vessels and rays act as good neighbors for lignification in poplar. If sufficient monolignols are produced by these cells, monolignols migrate over multiple cell layers, resulting in a restoration of the lignin amount to wild-type levels. If the supply of monolignols is limited, the monolignols are incorporated into the cell walls of the vessels and rays producing them and their adjoining cells resulting in fiber hypolignification. One such fiber-hypolignified line had 18% less lignin and, despite its small yield penalty, had an increase of up to 71% in sugar release on a plant base upon saccharification. © 2021 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Microbial lipids with fatty acid compositional profiles similar to vegetable oils are of great potential for the production of biofuels and oleochemicals. However, the costs of microbial lipids remain prohibitively high for broader applications. Microalgae known as the third-generation biomass resources may be explored to reduce the feedstock costs of lipid production. Here, hydrolysates of the microalga Arthrospira platensis were converted into lipids by the oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus curvatus ATCC 20509. Results indicated that hydrothermal pretreatment at 120 °C followed by enzymatic hydrolysis led to recovery of up to 97% total reducing sugar from microalgal biomass. While the as-prepared hydrolysates were ineffective for lipid production due to its nitrogen-rich nature, a high lipid content of 64.5% and a lipid yield of 0.233 g/g were obtained upon phosphate removal with calcium hydroxide. The lipid samples were found similar to palm oils in terms of fatty acid compositional profiles. This work demonstrated that A. platensis biomass can be readily converted into hydrolysates for high-yield lipid production, suggesting an alternative feedstock to cellulosic residues for microbial lipid technology and biorefinery. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Advances in synthetic biology have allowed photosynthetic cyanobacteria as promising "green cell factories"for sustainable production of biofuels and biochemicals. However, a limited of genetic switches developed in cyanobacteria restrict the complex and orthogonal metabolic regulation. In addition, suitable and controllable switches sensing and responding to specific inducers would allow for the separation of cellular growth and expression of exogenous genes or pathways that cause metabolic burden or toxicity. Here in this study, we developed a genetic switch repressed by NanR and induced by N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in a fast-growing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 along with its highly homologous strain S. elongatus PCC 7942. First, nanR from Escherichia coli and a previously optimized cognate promoter PJ23119H10 were introduced into Syn2973 to control the expression of the reporter gene lacZ encoding β-galactosidase, achieving induction with negligible leakage. Second, the switch was systemically optimized to reach ∼738-fold induction by fine-tuning the expression level of NanR and introducing additional transporter of Neu5Ac. Finally, the orthogonality between the NanR/Neu5Ac switch and theophylline-responsive riboregulator was investigated, achieving a coordinated regulation or binary regulation toward the target gene. Our work here provided a new switch for transcriptional control and orthogonal regulation strategies in cyanobacteria, which would promote the metabolic regulation for the cyanobacterial chassis in the future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microalgae as an alternative renewable resource for biofuel production have captured much significance. Nonetheless, its economic viability is a field of major concern for researchers. Unraveling the lipid catabolic pathway and gaining insights into the sequence-structural features of its primary functioning enzyme, Triacylglycerol lipase, will impart valuable information to target microalgae for augmented lipid content. In the present study, a genome-wide comparative study on putative Triacylglycerol lipase (TAGL) enzyme from algal species belonging to varied phylogenetic lineages was performed. The comprehensive sequence analysis revealed that TAGL comprises of three distinct conserved domains, such as, Patatin, Class III Lipase, and Abhydro_lipase, and also confirmed the ubiquitous presence of GXSXG motif in the sequences analyzed. In the absence of a crystal structure of algal TAGL till date, we developed the first 3D model of patatin domain of TAGL from an oleaginous microalga, Phaedactylum tricornutum, employing homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamic simulations methods. The domain-substrate complex having the low-ranking docking score revealed the binding of palmitic acid to the TAGL patatin domain surface with strong hydrogen bond interactions. The simulation results implied that the substrate-complexed patatin domain and the free enzyme adopted a more stable conformation after 40 ns. This is the first ever attempt to provide in-silico insights into the structural and dynamical insights on catalytic mechanism of the TAGL patatin domain. Subsequently, these findings aided our understanding on their structural stability, folding mechanism and protein-substrate interactions, which could be further utilized to design site-specific mutagenic experiments for engineering microalgal strains.

AB  - Purpose: Given that the depletion of fossil fuels is an important issue that should be tackled urgently, alternative routes are being sought for biofuels production. This paper, under this context, studied the potential synergies of co-treatment of two kinds of agro-waste (brewers’ spent grains, BSG and spent coffee grounds, SCG) towards the direction of biodiesel and bioethanol production, alleviating at the same time their treatment and management issues. Methods: The technical feasibility of oil extraction and ethanol production was studied and optimized in both laboratory and bench scale. A treatment train including alkaline pretreatment of SCG and dilute acid pretreatment of BSG, neutralization of the solutions by mixing them, enzymatic saccharification and ethanolic fermentation led to the production of bioethanol. Results: The co-treatment of BSG and SCG proved beneficial and optimum experimental conditions were defined by setting the bioethanol production cost as optimization parameter. The lowest ethanol production cost (3.9€/kg) was observed for scenario 4 (SCG/BSG mixture, chemical pretreatment (0.5 N, 5 h), enzymatic hydrolysis (400 µL/g cellulose, 16 h)) and scenario 5 (SCG/BSG mixture, chemical pretreatment (0.5 N, 5 h), enzymatic hydrolysis (800 µL/g cellulose, 5 h)). Further upscaling of the process verified the technical feasibility of process units leading to a further increase of ethanol yield and thus a decrease in the production cost. Conclusions: Conclusively, it was demonstrated that the recovery and extraction of the oil content of BSG and SCG and the achievement of high ethanol yields is technically feasible. Within this context, an integrated biorefinery was presented, making evident that these substrates could reverse the eminent energy crisis via biofuels production.

AB  - Herein, we successfully construct the 3D biocompatible graphene through crosslinking 2D graphene nanosheet onto carbon fiber paper with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) as anode of the alcohol biofuel cell. Compared with the bioanode without 3D graphene, the current density and output power of PDDA-graphene-ADH bioanode is increased by 23 % and 41 % at a high concentration of ethanol at pH 8.9, suggesting the stabilization role of graphene in enzyme loading. The study provides us a deep analysis on structures and performances of the bioanode incl. electrochemistry, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and atomic force microscopy images, which is significant to develop the new methods to construct 3D porous electrodes in energy conversion device. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Microbial poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) has been used as bioplastic, while the biopolymer of glucose (glycogen) can be used as efficient substrate for the generation of biofuels. Substantial production of PHB and glycogen by heterotrophic microbes has been constrained by the limited resources of organic substrates. Hence, the heterotrophic cultivation that efficiently converts an organic substrate to the two biopolymers is desirable. However, limited research has been conducted to examine the conversion efficiency of an organic substrate to biopolymers by photoheterotrophic microbes. In this study, the single-stage cultivation of a photoheterotrophic cyanobacterium (Chroococcus hansgirgi TISTR 8561) which accumulates PHB and glycogen was optimized and evaluated for the mass conversion efficiency (CE) of an organic substrate to the two biopolymers. The cells were cultured in BG11 trace element medium with addition of only a single specific organic substrate under light to enable both cellular oxygenic photosynthesis and heterotrophic metabolism, which were evidenced by the oxygen gas evolution and the organic substrate utilization of the cells, respectively. Through optimization of the culture conditions, organic substrate supply, and cultivation time, the mass CE of glucose to both PHB and glycogen of 51 ± 15% (w/w) was obtained, while the mass CE of acetate to these two biopolymers was 71 ± 16% (w/w). These optimized cultures exhibited CE of glucose or acetate to both PHB and glycogen at the higher levels than those of previous reports in photoheterotrophic microbes. This single-stage photoheterotrophic cultivation may be applied for production of biopolymers by other photoheterotrophic microbes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Future biorefineries are facing the challenge to separate and depolymerize biopolymers into their building blocks for the production of biofuels and basic molecules as chemical stock. Fungi have evolved lignocellulolytic enzymes to perform this task specifically and efficiently, but a detailed understanding of their heterogeneous reactions is a prerequisite for the optimization of large-scale enzymatic biomass degradation. Here, we investigate the binding of cellulolytic enzymes onto biopolymers by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy for the fast and precise characterization of enzyme adsorption processes. Using different sensor architectures, SPR probes modified with regenerated cellulose as well as with lignin films were prepared by spin-coating techniques. The modified SPR probes were analyzed by atomic force microscopy and static contact angle measurements to determine physical and surface molecular properties. SPR spectroscopy was used to study the activity and affinity of Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) glycoforms on the modified SPR probes. N-glycan removal led to no significant change in activity or cellulose binding, while a slightly higher tendency for non-productive binding to SPR probes modified with different lignin fractions was observed. The results suggest that the main role of the N-glycosylation in CBHI is not to prevent non-productive binding to lignin, but probably to increase its stability against proteolytic degradation. The work also demonstrates the suitability of SPR-based techniques for the characterization of the binding of lignocellulolytic enzymes to biomass-derived polymers.

AB  - L-malic acid is widely used in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we report on production of malic acid from xylose, the second most abundant sugar in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To enable malic acid production in a xylose-assimilating S. cerevisiae, we overexpressed PYC1 and PYC2, coding for pyruvate carboxylases, a truncated MDH3 coding for malate dehydrogenase, and SpMAE1, coding for a Schizosaccharomyces pombe malate transporter. Additionally, both the ethanol and glycerol-producing pathways were blocked to enhance malic acid production. The resulting strain produced malic acid from both glucose and xylose, but it produced much higher titers of malic acid from xylose than glucose. Interestingly, the engineered strain had higher malic acid yield from lower concentrations (10 g L‒1) of xylose, with no ethanol production, than from higher xylose concentrations (20 and 40 g L‒1). As such, a fed-batch culture maintaining xylose concentrations at low levels was conducted and 61.2 g L‒1 of malic acid was produced, with a productivity of 0.32 g L‒1 h. These results represent successful engineering of S. cerevisiae for the production of malic acid from xylose, confirming that that xylose offers the efficient production of various biofuels and chemicals by engineered S. cerevisiae. Graphical Abstract Lay Summary: (Figure presented.) L-malic acid is widely used in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, the authors constructed the engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing malic acid from xylose, the second most abundant sugar in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, and increased malic acid yield and productivity through the low-level xylose fed-batch strategy. This work suggests effective strategies in using xylose for the biological production of value-added products. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Hollow cobalt nitrogen-doped carbon (H-CoNC) is suggested for use in the membraneless hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (HPFC) and enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) as anodic catalyst boosting hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction (HPOR). For fabricating H-CoNCs, a facile spray pyrolysis-assisted process is used, and such produced H-CoNCs show a porous and hollow-shell structure, while they include a large amount of isolated Co atoms and coordinate bonds with Co and nitrogen (Co-N4). This structure promotes mass transfer to the active site and excellent catalytic activity for HPOR. With these benefits of H-CoNCs, the current density of the bioanode consisting of H-CoNC, carbon nanotube, and glucose oxidase (H-CoNC/CNT/GOx) observed at 0.3 V under 150 mM glucose is 315.5 μA cm−2, which is 2.1 times higher than that of a conventionally synthesized catalyst using Co-doped carbon nanoparticles (CoNC-NPs) (CoNC-NPs/CNT/GOx, 146.2 μA cm−2). With this superior catalytic activity for HPOR, maximum power density (MPD) of membraneless EBC using H-CoNC/CNT/GOx is 33.8 ± 4.52 μW cm−2, which is 52% higher than that of CoNP-NPs/CNT/GOx. In addition, a membraneless HPFC using H-CoNC/CNT demonstrates 4.87 times higher MPD (231.3 ± 11.3 μW cm−2) than that using CoNC-NPs/CNT, proving that H-CoNC improves the performance of fuel cells by its excellent catalytic activity. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) has emerged as one of the main strategies for generating renewable biofuels. For the efficient use of such feedstock, pre-treatments are essential. The hydrolysis of cellulose – major component of LCB – demands enzymatic cocktails with improved efficiency to generate fermentable sugars. In this scenario, lignocellulolytic fungi have enormous potential for the development of efficient enzyme platforms. In this study, two enzymatic cocktails were developed for hydrolysis of two lignocellulosic biomasses: industrial cellulose pulp and cassava peel. The solid biomass ratio in relation to the protein content of the enzyme cocktail was performed by experimental design. The optimized cocktail for the hydrolysis of cellulose pulp (AMZ 1) was composed, in protein base, by 43% of Aspergillus sp. LMI03 enzyme extract and 57% of T. reesei QM9414, while the optimal enzyme cocktail for cassava peel hydrolysis (AMZ 2) was composed by 50% of Aspergillus sp. LMI03 enzyme extract, 25% of the extract of P. citrinum LMI01 and 25% of T. reesei. The ratio between solids and protein loading for AMZ 1 cocktail performance was 52 g/L solids and 30 mg protein/g solids, resulting in a hydrolytic efficiency of 93%. For the AMZ 2 cocktail, the hydrolytic efficiency was 78% for an optimized ratio of 78 g/L solids and 19 mg protein/g solids. These results indicate that cocktails formulated with enzymatic extracts of P. citrinum LMI01, Aspergillus sp. LMI03, and T. reesei QM9414 are excellent alternatives for efficient hydrolysis of plant biomass and for other processes that depend on biocatalysis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Corn stover is the abundant biowaste that can be utilized to produce biofuels and high value-added biological products. However, the complex structures of lignocellulose, on the other hand, are highly resistant to subsequent transformations. To promote enzymatic saccharification of corn stover, green and safe phosphotungstic acid was used to pretreat corn stover. Using a single-factor experiment and response surface approach, the influence of different pretreatment variables such as temperature, phosphotungstic acid concentration, pretreatment time, and solid-to-liquid ratio on the pretreatment effect was investigated. The best conditions were 126 ℃, 1.33%, 45 min, and 1:14, respectively, and the cellulose conversion rate was the greatest at 70.61% combined phosphotungstic acid and cellulase, raised by 171.99% when compared to the raw corn stover. Phosphotungstic acid was demonstrated to degrade both hemicellulose and lignin, yielding 25.89 mmol/L xylose. Phosphotungstic acid pretreatment samples were found to be more porous, with cellulase adsorption capacity increased from 161.56 to 245.70 mg/g biomass. CrI/cellulose was found to decrease from 1.09 to 0.77, indicating significant chemical alterations in corn stover functional linkages. These findings suggest that phosphotungstic acid enhances saccharification by altering the structure and chemistry of corn stover. The combination of phosphotungstic acid and cellulase will give an efficient approach for increasing the saccharification of cellulose. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present study investigates the interactive effect of important growth media components (organic carbon, nitrate, and phosphate) on Scenedesmus sp. Interestingly, simultaneous enhancement of energy storage components and biomass was observed. Six carbon sources taken into consideration in this study affected the microalgal growth profile distinctively. As compared to other studied organic carbon sources, the addition of glucose (5 g L−1) resulted in the highest total biomass (3.7 ± 0.2 g L−1). Further, the combination of 5 g L−1 glucose supplementation with phosphate and nitrate starvation fetched the highest total lipids (331.5 ± 29.4 µg mg−1 and 281.6 ± 9.4 µg mg−1, respectively). Additionally, phosphate starvation with 5 g L−1 glucose supplementation fetched the highest total fatty acid content (118.35 µg mg−1). Carbohydrate content was the highest (1025.5 ± 83.9 µg mg−1) at 5 g L−1 of glucose, 1.5 g L−1 of NaNO3, and 0.04 g L−1 of K2HPO4 without compromising biomass accumulation. Principal component analysis confirmed that carbohydrate and protein concentrations in the algal biomass were closely related to enhanced biomass and chlorophyll concentration and were heavily impacted by NaNO3 in the presence of high organic carbon. This study supported in fetching the nutrient combinations, which increased biomass with wide range of fuel, as well as non-fuel applications.

AB  - The bagasse products generated after the extraction process have significant use in several industrial sectors however its application in the energy sector stands out, avoiding the use of fossil fuels. In this study an enzymatic process was applied through the Pleurotus sajor-caju fungus, for decomposition of the lignin present in the sugarcane bagasse, with the objective of improving the kinetic and bioenergetic parameters of this biomass. Detailed analyzes were carried out, such as kinetic, morphological, elementary and calorific, to verify its quality as biofuel. Values of Ea =31 kJ/mol to 65 kJ/mol, A = 1.4 105 s −1 to 3.0 105 s −1, ΔH = 26 kJ/mol to 60 kJ/mol, ΔG = 124 kJ/mol to 154 kJ/mol and ΔS = 150 J/mol to 157 J/mol for the conversion range (α) from 0.20 to 0.95, were obtained, with little variability in thermo-kinetic parameters. The HHV and fixed carbon values were 19.37 MJ/kg and 83.1%, respectively, demonstrating that this sugar cane residue has the potential to be used as a solid biofuel, after its use in the production of Pleurotus sajor-caju fungi, thus allowing to create more economic value in the sugar cane transformation chain. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recently liquid biofuels have proven to be a promising strategy to overcome the energy crisis. Agricultural residues such as lignocellulose are hydrolyzed and fermented to produce bioethanol. Fermentation interrupters such as furan derivatives and phenolic compounds obstruct the fermentation and eventuate with low concentration of bioethanol. These interventions in the formation of bioethanol make it inevitable to eliminate it from the fermentation media for the survival of microorganism to produce the desired product. Current investigation is focused on two strategies using 1% w/v of activated charcoal to improve the pretreatment and fermentation process. The concentration of bioethanol was compared to understand the effect of activated charcoal on the bioethanol production process. Group I: Cocoa pod shell was hydrolyzed and then treated with activated charcoal, while in Group II: Cocoa pod shell was hydrolyzed along with activated charcoal. Bioethanol concentration in Group I and Group II were observed to be 0.006 mg/mL and 3.06 mg/mL respectively. The investigation indicates that the strategy of cocoa pod shell hydrolysis with activated charcoal had a significant effect on bioethanol concentration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study the metabolic responses of Botryococcus braunii were analyzed upon different inorganic carbon dosages and nutrient limitation conditions in terms of lipid and biomass productivity, as well as photosynthetic performance. The nutritional schemes evaluated included different levels of sodium bicarbonate and nitrogen and phosphorus starvation, which were contrasted against standard cultures fed with CO2. Bicarbonate was found to be an advantageous carbon source since high dosages caused a significant increase in biomass and lipid productivity, in addition to an enhanced photosynthetic quantum yield and neutral lipids abundance. This contrasts to the commonly used approach of microalgae nutrient limitation, which leads to high lipid accumulation at the expense of impaired cellular growth, causing a decline in overall lipid productivity. The lipidome analysis served to hypothesize about the influence of the nutritional context on B. braunii structural and storage lipid metabolism, besides the adaptive responses exhibited by cells that underwent nutrient stress. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Membraneless microfluidic enzymatic biofuel cells (μEBFCs) operated under the co-laminar flow of fuel and oxidant often face cross-mixing issues, especially at low flow rates. In this work, we propose a new approach to design the single-stream μEBFC based on the investigation of relative positions of the electrodes at the top and bottom of the microchannel. To achieve this, a μEBFC was fabricated with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes via a stencil method. The bioanode and biocathode were modified with glucose dehydrogenase and laccase via direct covalent bonding, respectively. The best results were attained by placing the cathode at the top and anode at the bottom of the microchannel in a Y-shaped two streamflow μEBFC. When a single electrolyte stream was used to achieve more practicality and ease of use, the performance was reduced by 40%. However, with the new design of electrodes in single-stream μEBFC, i.e. cathode at the top and anode at the bottom facing each other in the microchannel, the performance was recovered by 20%. This corresponds to maximum current and power density of 216 ± 12 μA cm−2 and 69.2 ± 9.2 μW cm−2, respectively. The stacking ability of the device was realized by connecting the two cells in series and parallel. The maximum power density delivered by the two single-stream μEBFCs’ stack reached 160 μW cm−2 at 0.3 V. Thus, this study validates the viability of using single-stream μEBFCs in large stacks to power microelectronics more simply and practically. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Expert Systems are interactive and reliable computer-based decisionmaking systems that use both facts and heuristics for solving complex decision-making problems. Generally, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments are executed a random number of times (cycles) to get a stable production of power. However, presently there are not many algorithms or models for predicting the power generation stable criteria in microbial fuel cells. For stability analysis of Medicinal herbs’ CV profiles, an expert system driven by the augmented K-means clustering algorithm is proposed. Our approach requires a dataset that contains voltage-current relationships from CV experiments on the related subjects (plants/herbs). This new approach uses feature engineering and augmented K-means clustering techniques to determine the cycle number beyond which the CV curve stabilizes. We obtain an excellent estimate of the required CV cycles for getting a stable Voltage versus Current curve in this approach. Moreover, this expert system would reduce the time needed and the money spent on running additional and superfluous CV experiments cycles. Thus, it would streamline the process of Bacterial Fuel Cells production using the CV of medicinal herbs. © 2021, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cellulosic ethanol production will decrease our dependence on fossil fuels, positively impacting global warming, energy security, and urban pollution. In the last few years, our group has screened a few enzyme inhibitors of the phenylpropanoid pathway. We have shown that when some enzyme inhibitors are sprayed in young plants, they increase the lignocellulose saccharification in the long term at the workbench scale. Here, we screened five aromatic compounds for their ability to improve the saccharification of maize plants. Benzohydrazide increased saccharification in a broad range of concentrations in growth-room experiments, and it was selected for field-scale assays. At 20 g ha−1 (500 μM, 300 L ha−1), benzohydrazide increased by 33 and 46%, respectively, the saccharification of lignocellulose from maize leaves and stems. When the lignocellulose biomass of maize plants, sprayed with benzohydrazide or not, was submitted to hydrogen peroxide–acetic acid delignification pretreatment, benzohydrazide increased the saccharification by up to 76%. Benzohydrazide did not significantly affect any other biometric (length or fresh and dry weights) or biochemical (lignin, monolignols, structural hydroxycinnamates) parameters assessed. In brief, benzohydrazide could be used to improve saccharification in agroenergy crops.

Our objectives were to study the long-term effects of planted species composition and nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil microbial biomass C, extracellular enzyme activity, changes in total soil C, soil fertility and aboveground biomass yield in mixtures of native prairie species managed with and without N fertilizer for bioenergy production at four sites in Minnesota (MN), USA. Species were sown into mixture treatments and composition was not maintained (i.e., no weeding) throughout the duration of the study. Species mixture treatments at establishment included a switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) monoculture (SG), a four-species grass mixture (GM), an eight-species legume/grass mixture (LG) and a 24-species high diversity forb/legume/grass mixture (HD). Species diversity and aboveground productivity were similar for most mixture treatments at final sampling after 11 or 12 years of succession. Despite this homogenization of productivity and diversity throughout the study, the effects of planted species diversity and a decade of succession resulted in some differences in soil variables across species mixture treatments. On a peat soil in Roseau, MN, soil enzyme activities including β-glucosidase (BG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH) and phosphatase (PHOS) were highest in HD compared to GM treatments. On a sandy soil at Becker, MN, total soil C increased in all treatment combinations at the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depth intervals, with SG showing greater increases than HD at the 15-30 cm depth. Final soil pH also varied by species mixture at the Becker and Roseau sites, but differences in treatment comparisons varied by location. Nitrogen fertilization did not affect any response variable alone, but interacted with species mixture treatment to influence PHOS and total soil C at Becker. The inconsistent effects of species mixture and N fertilization on soil biological and chemical properties observed across sites highlight the importance of local soil and climate conditions on bioenergy and ecosystem service provisioning of perennial bioenergy cropping systems. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - In recent years, humanity has been called upon to redefine how it draws its energy reserves, as well as how to manage and regulate the final disposal of its waste into the environment. Biofuels are considered promising alternatives to fossil fuels. Especially, the second- and third-generation biofuels which are generated from agro-industrial waste can minimize the total disposal of residues, while they contribute to the renewable energy total supply. The current work focuses on the sustainable utilization of potato peel waste (PPW) as a viable raw material in a biorefinery, aiming to produce bioethanol and biogas. Setting dehydration as a necessary pretreatment step, the kinetics and the VFA (volatile fatty acid) production during drying of PPW were also studied. The best results in terms of bioethanol production (71.37 ± 2.47%) were reached when a chemical pretreatment step (NaOH 1% w/v) was included, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis with two different non-commercial enzymes, an amylolytic (NS22109, 50 μL/gstarch) and a cellulolytic (NS22177, 300 μL/gcellulose) enzyme, and alcoholic fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2% w/wdry PPW). As far as the integration of the processes is concerned, two different scenarios were investigated. The first included anaerobic digestion as a stand-alone procedure for the utilization of PPW and the second included ethanol production and subsequent valorization of stillage via anaerobic digestion. The latter proved as the best scenario for both the energy production and the solid residue degradation providing 7.15*103 MJ and 390 kg of fertilizer per ton of dry PPW. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aim of this study is uncovering potential strains of microalgae from Indore, Madhya Pradesh situated in central India with a diverse climate for sustainable production of different bio-products. Assessing the entire biochemical profile is crucial to select species- specific metabolites for sustainability of algal bio-refinery processes. In the current study, seven algal species (C. proboscideum, Desmodesmus psuedocommunis, Asterarcys quadricellulare, Ettlia texensis, Pediludiela daitoensis, Coelastrella sp., Pectinodesmus sp.) were isolated and identified using Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and 18 s rRNA sequences, and these species found to be from the Chlorophyta phylum. The highest biomass productivity (51.25 ± 1.96 μg/ml/day) with chlorophyll content (33.07 ± 0.63 μg/ml) was observed in A. quadricellulare on 21st day (P < 0.0001). Biochemical profiling of isolated species showed each species is unique in its biochemical composition (total lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins). Coelastrella sp. and Pectinodesmus sp. was found to be accumulating considerable quantities of (P < 0.0001) carbohydrates (303.3 ± 1.11 μg/mg dry cell weight) and lipids (212.67 ± 2.53 μg/mg per dry cell weight), respectively. Whereas P. daitoensis was found best (P < 0.0001) for protein production (205.78 ± 2.56 μg/mg dry cell weight), on 21st day. Highest total fatty acid content was detected in Pectinodesmus sp. (115.74 μg/mg) on 21st day, which has shown good saturated fatty acid (SFA) and mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) percentage, inflicting high quality biodiesel production. Confocal microscopy further supported the data. Assessing the biochemical profile at different phases of growth for each species therefore reduce the production time of biofuels as well as make this process much more cost-effective. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - In order to improve the economic feasibility and environmental sustainability of microalgal bioethanol production, a nontoxic, copious agricultural waste, sugarcane bagasse aqueous extract (SBAE) was used for cultivating Nannochloropsis oculata microalga (NNO-1 UTEX Culture LB 2164) as potential sources of substitutes for traditional nutrition to reduce the costs in cultivation through acid digestion and enzymatic treatment before being fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NRRLY-2034). The primary target of this research was to find out the ethanol from hydrolysate of the defatted biomass of N. oculata grown mixotrophically on SBAE and CO2 as carbon sources. For acid hydrolysis (AH), the highest carbohydrate yield 252.84 mg/g DW has been obtained with 5.0% (v/v) H2SO4 at 121 °C for 15 min for defatted biomass cultivated mixotrophically on sugarcane bagasse aqueous extract (SBAE) regarding 207.41 mg/g DW for defatted biomass cultivated autotrophically (control treatment). Whereas, the highest levels of reducing sugars has been obtained with 4.0% (v/v) H2SO4 157.47±1.60 mg/g DW for defatted biomass cultivated mixotrophically compared with 135.30 mg/g DW for the defatted control treatment. The combination of acid hydrolysis 2.0% (v/v) H2SO4 followed by enzymatic treatment (AEH) increased the carbohydrate yields to 268.53 mg/g DW for defatted biomass cultivated mixotrophically on SBAE regarding 177.73 mg/g DW for the defatted control treatment. However, the highest levels of reducing sugars have been obtained with 3.0% (v/v) H2SO4 followed by enzyme treatment that gave 232.39±1.77 for defatted biomass cultivated mixotrophically on SBAE and 150.75 mg/g DW for the defatted control treatment. The sugar composition of the polysaccharides showed that glucose was the principal polysaccharide sugar (60.7–62.49%) of N. oculata defatted biomass. Fermentation of the hydrolysates by Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the acid pretreated defatted biomass samples gave ethanol yield of 0.86 g/L (0.062 g/g sugar consumed) for control and 1.17 g/L (0.069 g/g sugar consumed) for SBAE mixotrophic. Whereas, the maximum ethanol yield of 6.17±0.47 g/L (0.26±0.11 g/g sugar consumed) has been obtained with samples from defatted biomass grown mixotrophically (SBAE mixotrophic) pretreated with acid coupled enzyme hydrolysis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The number of immobilized glucose oxidase (GOx) molecules is considerably increased by the structural modification of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and the performance of enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) is positively affected by the modification process. To do this, new rGO with three-dimensional open porous structure is formed by spray freeze drying method (sprGO), while tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) as mediator, and GOx are sequentially immobilized onto sprGO. To improve the loading amount of catalyst, rGO structure is modified to open porous sprGO structure possessing numerous anchoring sites, after which gelatin film crosslinked by glutaraldehyde is fabricated onto sprGO to prevent any losses of other components (sprGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin). Specific surface area and charge transfer resistance of sprGO are quantitatively measured, and the actual amount of immobilized GOx and the performance of EBFC using this catalyst are electrochemically examined. With this, it is found that the amount of GOx immobilized in sprGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin is twice better that in rGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin. More specifically, EBFC using this catalyst shows open circuit voltage of 0.85 V and maximum power density of 380 μW/cm2, and this is 1.4 times better than that using rGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin. These results indicate that the amount of immobilized GOx strongly affects the performance capabilities of EBFCs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Turkey, as an energy importing country, is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, bringing about an escalation in environmental problems and raising concerns regarding energy security. However, biowastes offer a potential solution to these woes, especially in Marmara Region of the country. In this study, the region’s potential in terms of the use of waste for energy production is analyzed. Within this context, agricultural and livestock wastes are examined in terms of their amounts, theoretical energy potentials, and associated costs to generate electricity. To evaluate economic costs, collection and feedstock costs for animal and agricultural wastes are used as input in three different scenarios based on FAO’s assessment. Based on the waste volumes and energy potentials thereof, it is found that biowastes can theoretically meet more than half of the electricity demand of the region. The results of the cost analysis demonstrate that both direct combustion of agricultural wastes and conversion of animal wastes to biogas in CHP plants to produce electricity are cost-effective in the context of various scenario options, considering the LCOE and feed-in-tariff values. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The production of high-activity β-glucosidase at low cost is essential to increase the efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis, necessary for the economically feasible production of biofuels from the conversion of renewable lignocellulosic resources, specifically agricultural waste. In this work, the Aspergillus niger CDBB-H-175 strain was used for the production of extracellular β-glucosidase. In the first stage of this work, the production of β-glucosidase was carried out in a shake flask, using different carbon sources in order to evaluate the effect of the substrate on enzyme activity; in this way, it was determined that the best substrate is maltose, obtaining 2954 U/ml of β-glucosidase activity at 31 days of culture. In the second stage, a laboratory-scale study was done using two discontinuous bioreactor systems for submerged fermentation, stirred tank and airlift, using maltose, sucrose, and glucose as a carbon source. The results showed that β-glucosidase with the highest enzymatic activity (3122 U/ml at 192 h of fermentation) was produced at uncontrolled pH conditions in an airlift bioreactor with maltose. In a third stage, using an airlift bioreactor with maltose, an orthogonal experimental design L4 with three factors was applied: pH, aeration, and maltose concentration. The aeration was of utmost importance to guarantee a better enzymatic expression, and acidification of the culture medium during the fermentation process was another necessary condition for a greater enzymatic production. © 2021 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.

AB  - A self-driven sensor that can detect urine and urine sugar and can be mounted on diapers is desirable to reduce the burden of long-term care. In this study, we created a paper-based glucose biofuel cell that can be mounted on diapers to detect urine sugar. Electrodes for biofuel cells were produced by printing MgO-templated porous carbon on which poly(glycidyl methacrylate) was modified using graft polymerization. A new bioanode was prepared through covalently modifying flavin-adenine-dinucleotide-dependent glucose dehydrogenase and azure A with pendant glycidyl groups of poly(glycidyl methacrylate). We prepared a cathode with covalently bonded bilirubin oxidase. Covalent bonding of enzymes and mediators to both the bioanode and biocathode suppressed elution and improved stability. The biofuel cell could achieve a maximum output density of 0.12 mW cm-2, and by combining it with a wireless transmission device, the concentration of glucose sensed from the transmission frequency was in the range of 0-10 mM. The sensitivity of the sensor was estimated at 0.0030 ± 0.0002 Hz mmol-1 dm3. This device is expected to be a new urine-sugar detection device, composed only of organic materials with a low environmental load and it can be useful for detecting postprandial hyperglycemia. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Rice straw is an important feedstock for second-generation biorefineries, the majority being conventional white rice. This research investigated the potential of the straw of black rice Chakhao Poireiton, a rice variety of increasing importance, for biorefining. Pre-treatment of black rice straw was carried out in a pressurised microwave reactor and free sugar release was measured following digestion with Cellic® CTec3. This was compared to white rice straw. Pre-treatment (100 − 200° C for 5 min) did not drastically impact the sugar composition but brought about an enhanced release of glucose after enzymatic hydrolysis from 25 to 50% (black rice) and from 26 to 55% (white rice). For xylose digestibility, the increase was around seven-fold for black rice (8 to 57%) and five-fold for white rice (13 to 64%). This improvement in digestibility of the straw samples could have come from modification in the lignocellulose structural features making the polysaccharides more susceptible to hydrolysis. Black rice could be a suitable feedstock for a combined biorefinery–food and nutraceuticals from grain (much higher than white rice) and the straw for fermentable sugars comparable to white rice straw for biofuels. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cellulases are among the most important groups of industrial enzymes that are widely consumed in biofuel production, pulp and paper, textile, and detergent industries. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was used for heterologous expression of a thermophilic cellulase collection. P. pastoris cells were transformed by the codon-optimized polycistronic EBG construct. This construct included egxA gene (from Ampullaria crossean, with endo- and exoglucanase activities), cglT gene (from Thermoanaerobacter brockii, with β-glucosidase activity), and zsgreen (a fluorescent marker). Gene expression was examined at mRNA level using RT-PCR technique. The results indicated successful transcription of all transgenes. CglT and ZsGreen recombinant proteins were respectively detected by enzymatic assay and fluorescent microscope, while endo- and exoglucanase activities were not determined by enzymatic assays. The highest β-glucosidase activity was measured at 65 ºC and pH 5.5. CglT is a good candidate for completing cellulase collections with low β-glucosidase activity. These cellulase sets could be used in biofuel production because of the high glucose tolerance property of CglT. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) is one of the few photoenzymes in nature. The ability of FAP to convert fatty acids into alka(e)nes without the need for reducing equivalents put this enzyme into spotlight for biocatalytic applications. Although it has been discovered only a few years ago, many studies already emerged demonstrating its potential in areas from biofuel production and enzymatic kinetic resolution to being a critical component of multi-enzyme cascades. While there have been few protein engineering studies for modulating activity of FAP towards very short chain fatty acids, no study has yet addressed substrate selectivity within the medium to long chain fatty acid range, where FAP shows great promise for the synthesis of drop-in biofuels from ubiquitous fatty acids with chain lengths from C12 to C18. Here, after determining optimum expression and assay conditions for FAP, we screened 22 rationally designed mutant enzymes towards four naturally abundant fatty acid substrates; C12 : 0, C16 : 0, C18 : 0 and C18 : 1. Depending on the type of the exchanged amino acid, we observed selectivity shifts towards shorter or longer chains, compared to wild type enzyme. Notably, we obtained two groups of mutants; one group with high selectivity towards only C18 : 0, and another group that is selective towards C12 : 0 substrate. Moreover, we measured light and thermal stability of the wild type enzyme as well as the light stability of a mutant engineered for selectivity. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Abstract: The efficient transformation of lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars is essential for building bioeconomies. Sugarcane is an important agricultural crop in a number of Latin American countries, including Brazil and Argentina. Herein culms from two different sugarcane (SC384 and SC724) and two energy cane varieties (EC3116 and EC3118) bred in Argentina were evaluated for sustainable production of second-generation biofuels and green chemicals. Changes in the biomass crystallinity, structure, and morphology introduced by pretreatments were investigated using X-ray diffraction (DRX), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Enzymatic hydrolysis yields of untreated and pretreated sugarcane and energy cane culms were determined and correlated with physical analyses and chemical composition characterizations. Overall, after combined acid and alkali pretreatment, enzymatic convertibility was highly efficient for all studied sugarcane and energy cane varieties, reaching over 97% of theoretical conversion yields. High crystallinity indices and crystallite sizes of pretreated culms and SEM results and CLSM were consistent with the removal of lignin, solubilization of hemicellulose, and amorphous parts of lignocellulose imprinted by the pretreatments. High potential of culms from sugarcane and energy cane varieties cultivated in Argentina for sustainable production of renewable lignocellulosic sugars and their transformation into green chemicals and fuels was demonstrated.

AB  - Prairie cordgrass (PCG) (Spartina pectinata Link) has been the focus of much scientific attention recently for use in biofuel applications, as it grows well on marginal lands that are unsuitable for row crops. This study investigated how the intercropping of kura clover (KC) (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb) with PCG for 8 yr affects soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fractions compared with N fertilization on marginally yielding croplands in South Dakota. This study was initiated in 2011 with five treatments: intercropping PCG with KC (PCG-KC), and PCG with N fertilizer at four levels: 0 kg N ha–1 (PCG-0N), 75 kg N ha–1 (PCG-75N), 150 kg N ha–1 (PCG-150N), and 225 kg N ha–1 (PCG-225N). Soil samples were collected in 2018 and analyzed for permanganate oxidizable C and N, stable C and N, mineralized C and N, dissolved organic C and N, and particulate organic C and N. Further, C and N management indices were calculated from these data. Results showed that permanganate oxidizable C and N and particulate organic C and N were generally higher under PCG-KC than under PCG-0N and PCG-75N but similar to PCG-150N and PCG-225N. Dissolved organic C and N and C mineralization were higher under PCG-KC compared with fertilized and unfertilized PCG. Prairie cordgrass–kura clover (190.10) recorded a 91% higher N management index than PCG-75N (99.66) but was similar to PCG-150N (165.70) and PCG-225N (163.10). This study concludes that growing KC–PCG mixture rather than using N fertilizers would have an overall positive effect on marginally yielding cropland soils. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Sweat could be a carrier of informative biomarkers for health status identification; therefore, wearable sweat sensors have attracted significant attention for research. An external power source is an important component of wearable sensors, however, the current power supplies, i.e., batteries, limit further shrinking down the size of these devices and thus limit their application areas and scenarios. Herein, we report a stretchable self-powered biosensor with epidermal electronic format that enables the in situ detection of lactate and glucose concentration in sweat. Enzymatic biofuel cells serve as self-powered sensing modules allowing the sweat sensor to exhibit a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.98 with a sensitivity of 2.48 mV/mM for lactate detection, and R2 of 0.96 with a sensitivity of 0.11 mV/μM for glucose detection. The microfluidic channels developed in an ultra-thin soft flexible polydimethylsiloxane layer not only enable the effective collection of sweat, but also provide excellent mechanical properties with stable performance output even under 30% stretching. The presented soft sweat sensors can be integrated at nearly any location of the body for the continuous monitoring of lactate and glucose changes during normal daily activities such as exercise. Our results provide a promising approach to develop next-generation sweat sensors for real-time and in situ sweat analysis.

AB  - Nitrogen is crucial for sugarcane crop to get economical sugar and biofuel throughout the world, and low nitrogen use efficiency is the main issue of sugarcane because of high nitrogen losses. In this experiment, physio-morphological, growth, and biochemical traits were observed for sugarcane genotypes (nitrogen inefficient-GT11 and efficient GXASF180-1-11) under 0.05 and 5 mMN levels at 5, 7, and 9 leaf stages. GXASF180-1-11 attained 46–58% and 16–23% more plant height and biomass than GT11, while photosynthesis and internal nitrogen use efficiency (iNUE) were 16 and 8% more at F2 fertilizer level, respectively. Highest key enzymes activity was showed in leaf whereas polynomial regression ranged between 0.53 and 0.98, 0.69 and 0.99 for iNUE and nitrogen use index. Principal component analysis explained 91.23–93.53% total variance across the stages. These results suggested that low nitrogen application rate with efficient germplasm may have the potential to improve iNUE for further cultivar development. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Biomass-degrading enzymes can aid the development of new technologies to increase the production efficiency of green fuels like ethanol. This study reports the identification and characterization of a novel glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) member from the digestive gland of the snail Achatina fulica, an endo-β-1,4-glucanase named AfEG66. The enzyme has a high level of identity with other mollusk endoglucanases and harbors a family 2 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM2) linked to a GH9 domain. Recombinant AfEG66 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography. The enzyme was active against barley β-glucan, lichenan, and showed a specific activity of 41.56 ± 1.21 IU/mg towards carboxymethyl cellulose. AfEG66 showed higher activities at pH 6.0–6.5 and 45 °C, being stable at temperatures equal or below 37 °C. The enzyme activity on cello-oligosaccharides with different glucose units was evaluated by thin-layer chromatography and showed the hydrolysis of substrates containing at least three glucose residues. A structural model was obtained to perform docking assays that clarified the hydrolytic properties of this enzyme. The results presented here show that A. fulica has an endogenous cellulase gene that encodes a GH9 endoglucanase associated to a putative CBM2 with β-1,4 glycoside hydrolase activity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Vanilla is one flavoring of worldwide importance, its production demands time from sowing and also an economic investment, thus resulting the processed vanilla obtained as extracts with a yield of 3–5% and the remaining is deemed as waste. However, waste may be used to generate added-value products. Objective of this research was to chemically and microstructurally identify and evaluate the main components of vanilla wastes using green technologies. For such purpose, an enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out separating components which may be employed through biotechnological processes. The presence of monosaccharides was identified in hydrolyzed fraction (HF) and non-hydrolyzed fraction (NHF) by Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and Mass Spectrometry (MS). Microstructural characterization by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) identified that fraction A constituted by pectin and free sugars is mainly located in internal tissues, lignin-rich D fraction was found in external structures. This work led to a chemical and structural analysis of vanilla beans waste as utilization component and to evaluate the use of enzymes. Further demonstrated is the advantage of enzyme use and their components due to their efficacy and selectivity, as well as the use of environmentally friendly reagents generating an alternative for using referred methodologies towards sustainable development. The identified compounds in vanilla waste hydrolyzed fractions, are within the polymers used as wall material for bioactive compound encapsulation in pharmaceutical, food and fragrances industries, as well as in energy sector for biofuel, production and biosorption of toxic metals in water treatment.

AB  - Key message: Disomic alien chromosome addition Brassica carinata lines with super-high erucic acid content were developed through interspecific hybridization with B. juncea and characterized using molecular, cytological and biochemical techniques. Abstract: Brassica carinata [A.] Braun (BBCC, 2n = 34) is a climate-resilient oilseed. Its seed oil is high in erucic acid (> 40%), rendering it well suited for the production of biofuel and other bio-based applications. To enhance the competitiveness of B. carinata with high erucic B. napus (HEAR), lines with super-high erucic acid content were developed through interspecific hybridization. To this end, a fad2B null allele from Brassica juncea (AABB, 2n = 36) was introgressed into B. carinata, resulting in a B. carinata fad2B mutant with erucic acid levels of over 50%. Subsequently, the FAE allele from B. rapa spp. yellow sarson (AA, 2n = 20) was transferred to the fad2B B. carinata line, yielding lines with erucic acid contents of up to 57.9%. Molecular analysis using the Brassica 90 K Illumina Infinium™ SNP genotyping array identified these lines as disomic alien chromosome addition lines, with two extra A08 chromosomes containing the BrFAE gene. The alien chromosomes from B. rapa were clearly distinguished by molecular cytogenetics in one of the addition lines. Analysis of microspore-derived offspring and hybrids from crosses with a CMS B. carinata line showed that the transfer rate of the A08 chromosome into male gametes was over 98%, resulting in almost completely stable transmission of an A08 chromosome copy into the progeny. The increase in erucic acid levels was accompanied by changes in the proportions of other fatty acids depending on the genetic changes that were introduced in the interspecific hybrids, providing valuable insights into erucic acid metabolism in Brassica. © 2021, the Crown.

AB  - C4 grasses are common species in rangelands around the world and represent an attractive option for second-generation biofuel production. Although they display high polysaccharide content and reach great levels of biomass accumulation, there is a major technical issue to be addressed before they can be used for bioethanol industrial production: lignin removal. Concerning this, Pycnoporus and Ganoderma fungal genera have been highlighted due to their ability to hydrolyze lignocellulose in biological pretreatments. Our goals here were to evaluate the pretreatment efficiency using the secretome of species from Pycnoporus and Ganoderma spp. harvested from a glucose-free inductive medium (using a C4 grass) and to identify the fungal enzymatic activities responsible for the lignin degradation and glucose release. Our results show that P. sanguineus secretome exhibits a higher activity of lignocellulolytic enzymes such as cellulases, xylanases, laccases, and manganese peroxidases compared with that from G. resinaceum. Interestingly, zymograms in the presence of 2 M glucose suggest that a β-glucosidase isoform from P. sanguineus could be glucose tolerant. The proteomic approach carried out allowed the identification of 73 and 180 different proteins in G. resinaceum and P. sanguineus secretomes, respectively, which were functionally classified in five main categories and a miscellaneous group. These results open new avenues for future experimental work that lead to a deeper comprehension and a greater application of the mechanisms underlying lignocellulosic biomass degradation. © 2021 The Mycological Society of America.

AB  - The production of biodiesel has increased globally during the last decade to overcome the problems of increasing prices of petro-diesel and the depletion of fossil fuels. The present study aimed to utilize agro-waste sugarcane bagasse (SCB) to synthesize a heterogeneous acid catalyst for biodiesel production using waste cooking oil. Waste sugarcane bagasse was converted into biochar through partial carbonization and activated via sulfonation by using acid solutions of different concentration i.e., 1M, 3M, 5M and concentrated sulfuric acid at a sulfonation temperature of 180 °C for 5 h. The prepared catalysts were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Sulfur (CHNS) analyzer. The prepared catalyst exhibited an excellent surface area of 20.78 m2 g–1 and a total acid density of 3.94 mmol g–1. The biodiesel production process was optimized by varying reaction temperature from (40–70 °C), methanol to oil molar ratio (5:1–20:1), catalyst loading (1–7 wt.%) and reaction time (5–25 min) by using a microwave reactor. The maximum conversion of 95.45% and yield of 92.12% was obtained under optimum conditions: catalyst loading 5 wt%, methanol-to-oil molar ratio (15:1), temperature (60 °C) after 15 min. The results of the experiments were validated by using response surface methodology, which validated the predicted model. The kinetic study of experiments showed that the use of sulfonated catalysts lowered the activation energy (10.5 kJ mol–1) and reactants attained an equilibrium point after a short interval under microwave heating. Reusability of catalyst up to seven cycles with 77.34% yield of biodiesel using low-grade feedstock showed that the catalyst is stable and can be used for sustainable biodiesel production. The utilization of wastes for catalyst synthesis and for biodiesel production can help to minimize the overall production cost of biodiesel. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - In recent years, the cultivation of hemp for seed has been gaining significant importance. Intensive breeding work resulted in the registration of a new oilseed hemp variety with high seed yield called Henola. Hemp of this variety is characterized by a vegetation period shorter by about a month, almost twice shorter technical length of plants and significantly larger inflorescences than fibrous hemp of the standard variety (Białobrzeskie). This work analyzes the efficiency of the second-generation bioethanol production process derived from the processing of waste biomass remaining after deseeding the panicles of the Henola variety. The research material consisted of biomass samples obtained from three variants of the fertilization experiment carried out at the IWNiRZ Experimental Farm in Stary Sielec in temperate climate conditions. In order to find out about the properties of the raw material, the chemical composition of hemp straw was tested and the bioethanol yield per 1 ha of crops was determined. Henola oilseed hemp straw yield was the lowest (10.6 Mg∙ha−1) in the case of the control and the highest (11.3 Mg∙ha−1) with the use of complex phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen fertilization. The average content of cellulose in the analyzed samples was 35.5%, holocellulose 68%, and hemicellulose 32%. The amount of lignin, in turn, was independent of the type of fertilization. The lowest bioethanol content, in the amount 7.11 g∙L−1, was found in case of hemp fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and the highest content amounting to 9.93 g∙L−1–for hemp fertilized with phosphorus and potassium, for which the ethanol yield, converted into straw yield was 2.7 m3∙ha−1. The conducted research covers both the identification of pro-environmental solutions in the economy for the management of waste biomass and the implementation of the RED II Directive on the promotion of energy from renewable sources. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study provides computational-assisted engineering of the cellobiohydrolase I (CBH-I) from Penicillium verruculosum with simultaneous enhanced thermostability and tolerance in ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvent, and concentrated seawater without affecting its wild-type activity. Engineered triple variant CBH-I R1 (A65R-G415R-S181F) showed 2.48-fold higher thermostability in terms of relative activity at 65°C after 1 h of incubation when compared with CBH-I wild type. CBH-I R1 exhibited 1.87-fold, 1.36-fold, and 1.57-fold higher specific activities compared with CBH-I wild type in [Bmim]Cl (50 g/L), [Ch]Cl (50 g/L), and two-fold concentrated seawater, respectively. In the multicellulases mixture, CBH-I R1 showed higher hydrolytic efficiency to hydrolyze aspen wood compared with CBH-I wild type in the buffer, [Bmim]Cl (50 g/L), and two-fold concentrated seawater, respectively. Structural analysis revealed a molecular basis for the higher stability of the CBH-I structure in which A65R and G415R substitutions form salt bridges (D64 … R65, E411 … R415) and S181F forms π–π interaction (Y155 … F181), leading to stabilize surface-exposed flexible α-helixes and loop in the multidomain β-jelly roll fold structure, respectively. In conclusion, the variant CBH-I R1 could enable efficient lignocellulosic biomass degradation as a cost-effective alternative for the sustainable production of biofuels and value-added chemicals. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Climate changes, environmental pollution and resource depletion are one of the numerous major problems humanity faces. United Nations sustainable development goals are aimed at solving these problems. The requirement for affordable, renewable, sustainable, biodegradable and environmentally friendly fossil fuel alternative sources is prompted by the development and advancement of biofuel production technologies. Of the various biofuel alternatives, biobutanol has increased the interests of researchers due to its desirable characteristics such as hydrophobicity, relatively high heating value and energy density, relatively low vapour pressure, etc. Nowadays, sustainable production of the biobutanol depends on the used feedstock source and its pre-treatment method, selected enhancing microorganism strain, acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation effectiveness and titer of biobutanol. The main research challenges in biobutanol production are an improvement of production efficiency and increasing the financial viability of the technology. This review summarizes the latest results of lignocellulosic components content and fermentable sugars composition in different agro-industrial residues; biobutanol production depending on the Clostridium enhancing strategy, process optimization and selection of substrate. Such analysis provides a better perception of the capability of using agro-industrial residues for biobutanol production efficiency. © 2021, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis is an essential step in the lignocellulosic biomass treatment for the conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose into fermentable sugars. In the present study, a physical steam explosion (200°C) and chemical alkaline pre-hydrolysis (10% v/v) were applied to hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) biomass, to verify the effectiveness of different pretreatment processes, in order to increase enzymatic hydrolysis and the final sugar yield. The enzymatic degradations were carried out also utilizing extremophilic microorganisms, exploited as a source of (hemi)cellulases to be used as components of the enzymatic cocktail applied in the bioconversion into fermentable sugars for production of second generation ethanol and high value products. Alkaline pretreatment showed to be superior over the physical method with respect to the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis, with the obtainment of an hydrolysis yields of 90% xylose and 40% glucose, respectively. © 2021 Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC.

AB  - The search for energy security and environmental sustainability has fueled a growing interest in biofuel production worldwide. Although first-generation bioethanol is regarded a clean, renewable, and green alternative to fossil fuels, its production process leads to the generation of a huge amount of waste with high polluting potential. This review article presents a thorough analysis of the production chain of sugarcane-based first-generation bioethanol and the chemical characterization of the wastes produced in this process. The sugarcane wastes analyzed in this work include three lignocellulosic materials, namely, sugarcane straw, bagasse, and filter press mud; bagasse ash, a material rich in silica particles and other oxides; and vinasse, a material containing high concentrations of organic matter and diverse nutrients. Considering the negative impacts of the disposal and/or containment of wastes generated during the production of sugarcane bioethanol, the review will shed light on the current value-added uses of these wastes and their potential for the development of highly innovative products. The current value-added uses of these wastes include tapping the energy present in straw and bagasse, by burning them in furnaces of bioethanol refineries, and the application of bagasse ash, filter press mud, and vinasse in agriculture as fertilizers and soil additives. With regard to the innovative application of bioethanol wastes, bagasse can be used for the production of second-generation ethanol, while bagasse ash can be employed as supplementary input for the production of construction materials. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Abstract: Open-field burning of rice straw contributes significantly to deterioration of air quality. Similarly, defatted algal residue is a surplus by-product of the algal biofuel industry. This study emphasizes on the two-step conversion of agro-industrial residues (rice straw and Scenedesmus obliquus deoiled biomass) into biodiesel and carotenoids using oleaginous red yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa R2. The effect of biological pretreatment on degradation of lignocellulosic substrates followed by catalytic saccharification was evaluated using suitable analytical techniques. Mixed biomass favoured the growth and secretion of extracellular cellulose degrading enzymes by Penicillium citrinum PKB20 resulting in the highest specific activity of endoglucanase (83.02 IU/mg), xylanase (103 IU/mg) and β-glucosidase (13.8 IU/mg) under solid-state fermentation. The hydrolysis of pre-treated substrate was achieved with a saccharification yield of 41.41 %. Batch fermentation of detoxified hydrolysate amended with synthetic yeast propagation or lipid production media (YEPD or C/N 75) resulted in maximum lipid content and lipid yield of 30.43 % and 1.19 g/L respectively. GC analysis revealed that oleic acid (29.4-50.39 %) was the predominant fatty acid. The crude carotenoid extract was composed of torularhodin, torulene and β-carotene and exhibited strong antioxidant activity.

AB  - In this work, a delignification process, using lime (Ca(OH)2 ) as an alternative alkali, was evaluated to improve enzymatic saccharification of corn stover cellulose, with the final goal of obtaining second-generation bioethanol. For that, an experimental design was conducted in order to assay the effect of temperature, lime loading, and time on the corn stover fractionation and enzymatic susceptibility of cellulose. Under conditions evaluated, lime pretreatment was selective for the recovery of cellulose (average of 91%) and xylan (average of 75.3%) in the solid phase. In addition, operating in mild conditions, a delignification up to 40% was also attained. On the other hand, a maximal cellulose-to-glucose conversion (CGCMAX) of 89.5% was achieved using the solid, resulting from the treatment carried out at 90◦C for 5 h and lime loading of 0.4 g of Ca(OH)2/g of corn stover. Finally, under selected conditions of pretreatment, 28.7 g/L (or 3.6% v/v) of bioethanol was produced (corresponding to 72.4% of ethanol conversion) by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Hence, the process, based on an alternative alkali proposed in this work, allowed the successful production of biofuel from the important and abundant agro-industrial residue of corn stover. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, microalgae have been regarded as useful organisms worldwide due to their potential for extensive application in renewable energy, aquaculture, biofuel and pharmaceuticals. Different species of microalgae have drawn significant interest because of their biological and chemical composition, which could potentially be useful in developing new applications in the aquaculture, biofuel and pharmaceutical industries. Furthermore, various culture techniques have been developed based on the species and environmental condition to ensure its mass production. Although microalgae are feasible sources for a successful biological product, limitations and challenges remain, which need to be solved with the innovation of new alternative technology in culturing and producing successful mass cultures. In this review, several current microalgae species production methods will be discussed based on their applications, and biological and chemical compositions, which are influenced by their growth parameters. © 2021 Penerbit UMT.

AB  - The development of green energy is important to mitigate global warming. Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) is a promising candidate for the production of alternative biofuel, which could reduce the burden on the Earth’s resources. Jatropha seeds contain a large quantity of lipids that can be used to produce biofuel, and the rest of the plant has many other uses. Currently, techniques for plant genetic transformation are extensively employed to study, create, and improve the specific characteristics of the target plant. Successful transformation involves the alteration of plants and their genetic materials. The aim of this study was to generate Jatropha plants that can support biofuel production by increasing their seed size using genes found via the rice FOX-hunting system. The present study improved previous protocols, enabling the production of transgenic Jatropha in two steps: the first step involved using auxins and dark incubation to promote root formation in excised shoots and the second step involved delaying the timing of antibiotic selection in the cultivation medium. Transgenic plants were subjected to PCR analysis; the transferred gene expression was confirmed via RT-PCR and the ploidy level was investigated. The results suggest that the genes associated with larger seed size in Arabidopsis thaliana, which were found using the rice FOX-hunting system, produce larger seeds in Jatropha. © 2021 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology.

AB  - Green diesel is a second-generation biofuel developed in response to the increasing demand for liquid fuel and the predicted decrease in the availability of fossil fuels, especially diesel as the main liquid fuel used in transportation vehicles. Green diesel can be produced via deoxygenation from various feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, fatty acids, and waste cooking oils. Normally, the deoxygenation reaction in green diesel production occurs in a multiphase system. There are three main pathways in the liquid phase of the reaction: decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation, from which liquid alkane hydrocarbons can be derived, and these are known as green diesel. This review paper discusses several deoxygenation pathways in a multiphase-reaction process to produce green diesel. Nickel metal is a non-noble metal catalyst which has been confirmed from many studies for use in deoxygenation with good performance. The performance of the nickel catalyst depends on different factors including the type of catalyst support and promoter, reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and reaction time. Finally, recent progress and future trends in green diesel production are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: An integrated approach for the co-production of food, feed and biofuel has the potential maximise the economic value from Jerusalem artichoke (JA). A biorefinery approach was used for extracting protein and inulin from JA tubers, and producing ethanol from the extraction residues using an optimised cocktail of enzymes. Method: Inulin and protein products were pre-extracted from tubers, resulting in tuber residues with unextracted inulin (38%) and lignocellulosic fibres (25%). Fed-batch fermentation was used for ethanol production from the residues, using a mixture design, to optimize the cocktail of exo- and endoinulinase, Cellic® CTec3 and Pectinex Ultra-SP, to minimise the total enzyme dosage and maximise the sugar conversion and ethanol yields during simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of the residues, by exploiting synergistic action among enzymes in the cocktail. Results: High gravity fermentation of the residues with 21% w/v solids loading, resulted in an ethanol concentration and yield of 38 g/L and 83% of the theoretical max, respectively, and a combined inulin and cellulose conversion yield of 74%. Synergistic co-operation among the enzymes improved the hydrolysis of inulin and LCFs. The enzyme cocktail demonstrated a degree of synergy that resulted in the highest sugar yield of 0.74 g/gsugars compared to yields in the range of 0.10–0.39 g/gsugars for individual enzymes. The xylose and glucan recovery yield for this optimised cocktail was 62 and 66%, respectively. Ethanol yields were improved from 37%, when using individual enzymes, to 83%, when using the enzyme cocktail. Conclusions: Synergistic co-operation among the hydrolytic enzymes significantly improved the saccharification and fermentation efficiency of the tuber residues, in part due to optimisation of the composition of the enzyme cocktail preparation. The optimised cocktail resulted in substantial LCFs conversion without the pre-treatment of the tuber residues.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an important resource for biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts; however, deconstructing its recalcitrant structure is a challenge. In this study, controlled instant pressure drop (DIC)-assisted alkaline pretreatment process of poppy capsule waste (PCW) was developed and statistically optimized with the aim of enhanced fractionation efficiency and production of fermentable sugars and xylooligosaccharides (XOs). The effects of DIC process variables on PCW fractionation were investigated. The optimal DIC conditions were found as 5 bar vapor pressure, 540 s processing time, and 9% (w/w) moisture content. At the second stage, optimum conditions for alkaline extraction were found as 22.58% (w/w) KOH, 1-h extraction time, and 22.15 mL precipitant volume. Process optimization concluded a hemicellulose separation yield of 26.37±0.08%, corresponding to 104.7% increase. Process optimization also contributed to the sustainability of the process by reducing KOH and precipitant consumption by 9.7% and 11.4%, respectively, with a concurrent shortening of the processing time from 24 to 1 h. DIC pretreatment enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of PCW, and a maximum glucan-to-glucose conversion yield of 22.85±0.74% was obtained, which corresponds to a 9-fold increase. Hydrolysis of PCW and hemicellulose-rich fraction by xylanase yielded xylose-free xylobiose (X2) as the principal product. SEM analysis demonstrated the expansion of PCW structure by DIC pretreatment, reasoning the higher fractionation efficiency and enzymatic hydrolysis yields. The optimized process could be an efficient option for lignocellulose fractionation, enzymatic saccharification, and XOs production within biorefinery concept while reducing the requirement for chemicals and processing time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microalgal lipids are highly promising feedstocks for biofuel production. Microalgal lipids, especially triacylglycerol, and practical applications of these compounds have received increasing attention in recent years. For the commercial use of microalgal lipids to be feasible, many fundamental biological questions must be addressed based on detailed studies of algal biology, including how lipid biosynthesis occurs and is regulated. Here, we review the current understanding of microalgal lipid biosynthesis, with a focus on the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We also present possible solutions for overcoming various obstacles to understanding the basic biology of microalgal lipid biosynthesis and the practical application of microalgae-based lipids. This review will provide a theoretical reference for both algal researchers and decision makers regarding the future directions of microalgal research, particularly pertaining to microalgal-based lipid biosynthesis. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

AB  - Microalgae research has attracted interest worldwide and in order to advance algal biotechnology in Brazil, government has been funding several projects. In the last 10 years, two main funds were provided by the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) agency to researchers in Brazil, who study the potential uses of microalgae for biomass, bioproducts and biofuels production. These funded projects addressed aspects of algal strain identification, development of algal cultivation techniques, designing photobioreactors and raceway ponds, modeling harvesting and dewatering process, maximizing biomass and oil productivities, characterizing chemical composition with different extractions systems and determining physiochemical properties of biodiesel. This review presents the state of art of algal research conducted by Brazilian institutions. Special attention is given to the recent progress on microalgal cultivation, high-value products extracted from microalgae and potential biofuels production. This review may serve as a policy instrument for planning next steps for algal research in Brazil as well as for attracting attention from international researchers who work with microalgae and would like to pursue a future partnership on algal research with Brazilian research institutions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Grape pomace is a lignocellulosic waste of wine industry, which comprises high moisture content, cellulose, and hemicellulose, making it a viable substrate to microorganisms. Also, it is a potential substrate for bio-products such as enzymes and biofuels. Thus, the aim of the study was at the optimization of solid to liquid ratio (w/v), pH, and fermentation period for maximal cellulase of Bacillus subtilis natto DSM 17766 by the Box-Behnken response surface method (RSM) using grape pomace hydrolysate (GPH). The GPH was obtained by autoclaving the grape pomace slurry prepared with 3% (w/v) H2SO4, shown to be better than 5%, at 121.1 °C for 15 min and filtering after pH adjustment. Cellulase was assayed by the DNS method using filter paper as substrate. The maximum cellulase activity was predicted at 0.178 IU/mL with solid to liquid ratio of 15:100 (w/v), pH 6.0, and 7 days of fermentation according to the response surface model, which agreed well to its experimental counterpart (0.176 IU/mL). The results also confirm higher impact of fermentation period and pH in comparison to change in grape pomace amount.

AB  - This study assessed the potential of termite gut inhabiting bacteria towards bioconversion of cellulosic waste into biofuel. Total seven bacterial isolates from the gut of Heterotermes indicola were isolated. Among all the isolates, HI-1 produced the largest zone upon primary screening. Untreated paper had more cellulose content (73.03%) than acid (0.5%) treated paper that was used as a lignocellulosic substrate for saccharification. Among all the isolates tested, glucose yield (1.08mg/mL) was high for HI-1 isolate. Several factors were considered for optimizing augmented glucose yield (8.57mg/mL) and growth (8.07×108cfu/mL), such as temperature 37°C, pH 4.5, 5% (w/v) substrate concentration, 6 % bacterial inoculum size, agitation 150 rpm with PEG 0.25 % and Ca2+ ions 0.002 g/L. Overall 8-fold increase in glucose yield was achieved. Enzyme activity of HI-1 showed higher endoglucanase 0.29 ± 0.01 (U/mL/min) and exoglucanase 0.15±0.01 (U/mL/min) activity under optimum conditions, mentioned above. temperature 37°C, pH 4.5, substrate concentration 5%, inoculum size 6%, surfactants PEG 0.01%, ions Ca2+(0.002g/L) and agitation (120 rpm). Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of hydrolyzed office paper yielded 5.43mg/mL bioethanol. According to 16S rRNA sequence homology, the bacterial isolate H1 was identified as Alcaligenes faecalis. Bioethanol production from office paper untreated waste proved an effective strategy. Bacteria having natural tendency towards cellulosic waste consumption are promising for bioconversion of cellulosic waste to valuable products. © 2021, University Federal de Uberlandia.

AB  - Despite being considered renewable, corn (Zea mays) ethanol still generates much debate over the use of fossil fuels in its production and is considered less sustainable than sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) ethanol. In Brazil, corn ethanol is starting to be produced in the Center-West and is expected to increase with the RenovaBio, a promising policy for biofuels adoption. In this context, energy cane (Saccharum spp.) is a biomass crop with high yields that can provide bagasse to supply the energy demand of the corn ethanol industry and provide juice with about 10% sugar content. However, the effects of introducing its juice in the production process are unknown. For these reasons, the objective of this study was to assess the effects of adding energy cane juice in corn ethanol production. Energy cane juice brings several advantages: (i) It provides sugars that can reduce by almost 50% the amount of corn and enzymes used, (ii) reduces the amount of water needed for ethanol production, and (iii) increases significantly the fermentation efficiency from 86.4% to 90.8% by providing minerals that support yeast growth. Therefore, energy cane can be integrated into the corn ethanol production process, making the fermentation more efficient and the production systems more sustainable. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Lignocellulosic materials are currently the most economic and environmental friendly precursors for production of fuel and biochemical. Understanding the intricate effect of pretreatment on the lignocellulosic composition would be an advantage to predict their proper utilization for biochemical production. Compressed Hot-Water (CHW) pretreatment was used to disrupt Corn stalk (CS) cell walls at temperature range 100–200 ​°C for reaction time 10 ​min. Highest glucose recovery was recorded in CS pretreated at 180 ​°C while furfural, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) and total phenolics concentrations were highest in 200 ​°C. Crystallinity Index (CrI) of the pretreated CS increased with increase in severity of the Pretreatment Temperature (PT); while Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic images showed changes in the functional groups of CS as the PT was gradually intensified. Cumulatively, changes in chemical and structural profile of pretreated lignocellulosic material could be determining factor for its utilization in the production of biofuels and biochemicals. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The problem of crude oil reserve shortage and air quality decline currently have led researches on renewable fuel such as bioethanol and biohydrogen. The attempt to provide such biofuel involves the utilization of enormously available wasted materials, lignocellulose. Coconut husk is one of such materials available in Indonesia. The previous work had reported the quantity of total reducing sugar produced after the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated coconut husk. The pretreatment methods used were dilute sodium hydroxide solution (1 and 4% w/v), 1,3-methylmethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate ionic liquid and the combination of both methods. This work focused on constructing the mathematical model which describes the kinetic of those enzymatic hydrolysis reactions. Mathematical model expressions help describing as well as predicting the process behavior, which is commonly needed in the process design and control. The development of mathematical model in this work was done based on the total reducing sugar concentration resulted in batch hydrolysis reaction. The kinetic parameters including initial available substrate (S0), maximum reaction rate (rmax), and half-maximum rate constant (KM). According to the values of half-maximum rate constant (KM), the enzymatic hydrolysis performance of coconut husk treated using ionic liquid is better than that treated using dilute alkaline solution as the former had shown lower KM value and hence higher enzyme affinity to the substrate. The best hydrolysis result was performed using combination of 1% dilute sodium hydroxide solution and ionic liquid with kinetic model parameter of 0.5524 g/L.h of rmax, 0.0409 g/L of KM, and 4.1919 g/L of S0.

AB  - Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire has been synthesized by electrodeposition technology and fully characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, UV–Vis absorption spectra and Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements. The synthetic ZnO nanowire has been applied as a semiconductor photoanode of a photoelectrochemical biofuel cell (PEBFC) to evaluate its impact on solar-to-electric conversion efficiency. The ZnO-based PEBFCs show a short-circuit current (Isc) of 104.70 μA, an open-circuit potential (Voc) of 947 mV, a maximum power density (Pmax) of 37.80 μW/cm2 and an overall energy conversion efficiency (η) of 2.31%, respectively. The PEBFCs comprising of ZnO nanoparticles semiconductor photoanode show improved electrochemical performances comparing the reported TiO2-based PEBFC. The ZnO-based PEBFCs also indicate a higher incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency, which is probably due to the large electron mobility and high electrical conductivity for ZnO. The relevant studies on the semiconductor photoanodes provide meaningful value for the development of high-performance PEBFCs. © 2021, Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science.

AB  - Microalgae are promising raw materials for biorefinery systems as they are rich in nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, pigments). Although there are different studies on the production of ethanol from microalgae with different types of pre-treatments for the utilisation of whole biomass, researches of ethanol production from residues of protein extraction from defatted biomass of Arthrospira platensis biomass has not been found in the literature. In this context, the objective of this study was to use the residues of the protein extraction process to produce ethanol (byproduct) in a biorefinery concept. Enzymatic hydrolysis (pH 5.5; 50 °C) were carried out with different concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5% (v/v)) of the enzymes α-amylase and amyloglucosidase (AMG), added simultaneously. For the fermentation stage conducted with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, four different media were tested (H–pure hydrolysate; C1–control 1, reduced sugars in the same proportion of medium H; C2–control 2, simulating the production of sugarcane ethanol; HS–hydrolysate supplemented with nutrients in order to obtain the same composition as C2). The medium H presented better results than the others, it produced 8.06 g/L of ethanol over 12 h, with a 100% theoretical yield of ethanol. These results indicate that the nutrients present in the hydrolysate of the residual fractions were sufficient to promote yeast growth and ethanol production. Moreover, the results from this work show the feasibility to obtain protein concentrate and ethanol from Arthrospira platensis, in an integrated process. (Figure presented.) HIGHTLIGHTS It was possible to perform an integrated process to extract proteins and produce bioethanol from S. platensis. Nutrients on hydrolysate from residual fractions was sufficient to promote yeast growth and bioethanol production. Bioethanol production from hydrolysed residual fractions was 100% efficient. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Macroalgal biomass for bioethanol production has proved to be a viable alternative to feedstocks of first-generation (food crops rich in starch) and second-generation biofuel (agricultural residues and woody biomasses rich in lignocellulosic components). Production of bioethanol from biomass involves fermentation of mixed monosugars such as glucose, xylose, galactose, rhamnose, mannose, and fucose, and abundant monomer is found in algal biomass as well as lignocellulosic biomass. The inability of commonly used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to ferment xylose (pentose) sugar has led to the exploration of robust yeast strains that can utilize mixed sugars to produce ethanol. This study focuses on the isolation of yeast strains from various fruits and fermented products to determine efficacy in ethanol production using synthetic and macroalgal sugar. Two strains prioritized based on ethanol yield are Meyerozyma caribbica (isolated from cashew-fermented juice) and Pichia kudriavzevii (isolated from toddy). Strain P. kudriavzevii is thermotolerant (at 45 °C), whereas M. caribbica is tolerant to high salinity and produced ethanol of 2.6 g/L from 5.95 g/L of sugar, achieving 88.8% fermentation efficiency. P. kudriavzevii strain exhibits ethanol tolerance up to 4%. Fermentation of synthetic glucose produced 1.35 g/L and 1.44 g/L ethanol by M. caribbica and P. kudriavzevii strains with fermentation efficiencies of 83.6% and 94.8% respectively. M. caribbica strain fermented xylose and produced 1.4 g/L of ethanol achieving 14.9% fermentation efficiency, while simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process using P. kudriavzevii strain exhibited efficiency of 65.1% and 80.9% for Enteromorpha intestinalis and Ulva lactuca respectively. Cellulolytic activity of the prioritized strains was determined to carry out consolidated bioprocess.

AB  - –This study analyzes the current regulatory system for genetic engineering in Russia in terms of expected amendments related to genome editing technology, given that its products — genome-edited crops — have already appeared on the international market. A list of corresponding concepts that require legal rethinking and definition has been compiled. Changes in the model of state regulation of genetic technologies in Russia are proposed: the transition from a process-oriented regulation system to a risk-based system. To assess the risk of public rejection of the products of genetic technology and new biotechnologies, 931 participants of the opinion poll have been selected who underwent an online sociological survey using purposive sample techniques. The obtained results revealed the innovation potential of the Russian society and experts in the novel genetic and digital technologies in agriculture, their attitude to the threat of global hunger and the application of biodegradable materials and biofuels in relation to the circular economy. © 2021.

AB  - Abstract: Lignocellulosic biomass is a high potential feedstock to produce biofuels and value-added products contributing to sustainable bioeconomy. Nevertheless, biomass recalcitrance reduces the yield of processing routes, and therefore, characterization of structural and chemical factors contributing to this resistance must be carried out by robust but rapid and economical analytical techniques. In this work, the recalcitrance of eight lignocellulosic biomass samples: agave bagasse (AB), banana peel (BP), corn cob (CB), barley straw (BS), orange peel (OP), pineapple peel (PP), sugarcane bagasse (SB) and sawdust (SW), was performed infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The classification of chemical and thermal behavior was based on principal components analysis (PCA) by similarity to four reference materials, cotton fiber (CF), lignin (LG), citrus pectin (CP) and potato starch (PS). The results indicate a clear trend of recalcitrance in four well-defined groups (GPI–GPIV): GPII or lignin-like biomasses (LG and AB) were assessed as the most recalcitrant biomass type (devolatilization temperature: ~ 150 °C, remaining weights > 30wt%), followed by GPI or cellulosic-like biomass (CF, SW and SB), which contain high amounts of cellulose that increase its recalcitrance to thermal degradation (devolatilization temperature: 200–380 °C, remaining weights < 20wt%). GPIII or pectin-like biomasses (CP, PP, OP, BP), known to be significant sources of pectin and hydrolyzable polysaccharides, were classified as intermediated recalcitrance biomasses (devolatilization temperature: 150–350 °C, remaining weights < 30%wt,), whereas GPIV or starchy-like biomasses (PS, BS and CB) were the least recalcitrant materials (devolatilization temperature: 250–350 °C, remaining weights < 30 wt%). This methodology could be applied to classify novel uncharacterized lignocellulosic biomasses irrespectively of their origin based on their similarity to reference materials and to preselect the processing route, to biofuels or biomaterials, in a fast and economical manner.

AB  - Cynara cardunculus (artichoke) is a perennial plant of the Mediterranean basin, known since antiquity as food and for its therapeutic properties. Cynara is a relatively small genus with two cultivated species and one wild one. Recently, successful efforts have been made to cultivate wild cardoon and monetise it as a bioenergy crop. In this study, the seeds of an established Greek cultivar of C. cardunculus, cultivated in the experimental field and used as biofuel, have been researched for their chemical profile and nutritional value. According to the results, six lignans were isolated [arctigenin, arctiin, trachelogenin, tracheloside, cynarinine, and ethylate of trachelogenin (isolated for the first time from a natural source)] as well as the most characteristic metabolites of the genus (linoleic acid, trilinolein, and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid). Moreover, the total phenolic content (31.18-54.51 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract) and antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities of the seeds have been evaluated and showed strong antioxidant properties (44.42-516.81 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract) as well as satisfactory bleaching (enzyme tyrosinase, 16.95-23.80 mg kojic acid equivalents/g extract), antidiabetic (enzymes a-amylase, a-glucosidase, 0.14-1.75 mmol acarbose equivalents/g extract), and protective against neurodegenerative disease (cholinesterase enzymes, 0.49-1.22 mg galanthamine equivalents/g extract) activities. The nutritional evaluation of the seeds confirmed them as a rich source of unsaturated fatty acids, dietary fibre (24.1%), and high protein content (19.3%). It is noteworthy that such a neglected bioactive by-product, with essentially high nutritional value, as the studied seeds could be investigated for its value-added applications towards food and food supplements areas. © 2021 American Medical Association.

AB  - CO is a promising substrate for producing biochemicals and biofuels through mixed microbial cultures, where carboxydotrophs play a crucial role. The previous investigations of mixed microbial cultures focused primarily on overall community structures, but under-characterized taxa and intricate microbial interactions have not yet been precisely explicated. Here, we undertook DNA-SIP based metagenomics to profile the anaerobic CO-driven microbiomes under 95 and 35% CO atmospheres. The time-series analysis of the isotope-labeled amplicon sequencing revealed the essential roles of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria under high and low CO pressure, respectively, and Methanobacterium was the predominant archaeal genus. The functional enrichment analysis based on the isotope-labeled metagenomes suggested that the microbial cultures under high CO pressure had greater potential in expressing carboxylate metabolism and citrate cycle pathway. The genome-centric metagenomics reconstructed 24 discovered and 24 under-characterized metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), covering more than 94% of the metagenomic reads. The metabolic reconstruction of the MAGs described their potential functions in the CO-driven microbiomes. Some under-characterized taxa might be versatile in multiple processes; for example, under-characterized Rhodoplanes sp. and Desulfitobacterium_A sp. could encode the complete enzymes in CO oxidation and carboxylate production, improving functional redundancy. Finally, we proposed the putative microbial interactions in the conversion of CO to carboxylates and methane. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Society for Microbial Ecology.

AB  - Argan pulp is an abundant byproduct from the argan oil process. It was investigated to study the feasibility of second-generation bioethanol production using, for the first time, enzymatic hydrolysis pretreatment. Argan pulp was subjected to an industrial grinding process before enzy-matic hydrolysis using Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5 L, followed by fermentation of the resulting sugar solution by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The argan pulp, as a biomass rich on carbohydrates, presented high saccharification yields (up to 91% and 88%) and an optimal ethanol bioconversion of 44.82% and 47.16% using 30 FBGU/g and 30 U/g of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5 L, respectively, at 10%w/v of argan biomass. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Converting the chemical and biologically resistant structure of cellulosic biomass into useful products is a technological and economic challenge. The use of sustainable and efficient conversion technology sustainably has been gaining prominence. This work aimed to evaluate the integration of subcritical water hydrolysis (SWH) and enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane straw to obtain fermentable products and second-generation ethanol. SWH was conducted under semi-continuous conditions at 200 °C, 5 mL/min, and a 19-min retention time. Enzymatic hydrolysis using an enzyme blend produced simple sugars that were evaluated for fermentation using two strategies: (i) Saccharomyces cerevisiae SA-1; and (ii) co-culture of S. cerevisiae SA-1 and Scheffersomyces stipitis NRRLY-7124. Integrating subcritical water and enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in greater fermentable sugar yield (2.40 ± 0.01 g/L of xylose and 8.9 ± 0.6 g/L of glucose) than subcritical pre-treatment on its own. The co-culture fermentation strategy was more efficient than fermentation by S. cerevisiae on its own, resulting in 2.8 ± 0.3 g/L of ethanol. Subcritical water hydrolysis pre-treatment disrupted the lignocellulosic matrix, leading to increased enzymatic accessibility of cellulose, with minimal formation of degradation compounds, and with minimal waste formation. Future work can optimize the hydrolysis process to increase the yield of simple sugars, increase fermentation efficiency by controlling oxygen concentration and removing acetic acid, and consequently increase the yields of second-generation ethanol.

AB  - In the large-scale commercial bioconversion of complex lignocellulosic materials to biofuels, a cost-effective purification and production of cellulase is a huge concern. In this regard, genetically engineered strains have shown great merits for producing active cellulase. As an attempt to improve cellulase production, herein, bacterial strains with cellulolysis activity were collected from forest soils located across Mazandaran Province, in central-northern Iran. To verify cellulolysis activity, carboxymethyl cellulose in aka cellulose gum medium was used. Afterward, in order to characterize the bacteria with most cellulolysis activity, 16S rDNA of bacterial colonies was amplified, and then, phylogenetic analysis was conducted. Cellulase gene was isolated from the most active bacterial strain, Bacillus subtilis B2, and then, it was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-26b using HindIII and BamHI restriction endonuclease sites. The generated plasmid containing cellulase and expression promoter system was transformed into the BL21 (DE3) competent Escherichia coli. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis was performed to verify the successful cloning and presence of the protein. The sequencing of cloned gene revealed 77% identity with endoglucanase of B. subtilis subsp. In addition, the molecular weight of cloned cellulase was 48 kilo Daltons as revealed by SDS-PAGE. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

AB  - Climatic changes and drought reduced plant growth and development. Brassinosteroids act in maintaining turgor and plant growth, increasing tolerance to water stress. The objective of the present study was to identify the effect of brassinosteroids in reducing stresses caused by water deficit in Jatropha curcas L. plants. The study was carried out in a greenhouse at the State University of Goiás, in a completely randomized block design in a factorial 2 × 5 arrangement (plants submitted to five brassinosteroids concentrations (0, 2, 4, 8, 16 mg L−1) and two levels of daily water supply (50% and 100% evapotranspiration) six replications and the plot consisted of one useful plant. A 10 mL volume of the hormone was applied 30 days after emergence and 20 mL at 60 days after emergence, totaling 30 ml. The water deficit was imposed at 70 days after emergence and the evaluations were made at 100 d after emergence. Under water deficit, production increased of reactive substances that damage membranes and proteins, but brassinosteroids played an important role in mitigating the deleterious effects of water deficit on J. curcas plants by acting as an elicitor in activating photoprotection mechanisms that increased vegetative growth and maintained membrane integrity. The antioxidant and growth machinery activation reached maximum points at the 8 mg L−1 brassinosteroids concentration and even higher concentrations. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Sugarcane being the major contributor of sugar and potential source of biofuel around the globe, occupies significant commercial importance. Red rot is the most devastating disease of sugarcane, severely affecting its quality as well as yield. Here we report the overexpression of SUGARWIN1 and SUGARWIN2 genes in any field crop for the first time. For this purpose, SUGAWIN1 and SUGARWIN2 were cloned downstream of maize ubiquitin (Ubi-1) promoter to construct two independent expression cassettes. The bar gene conferring resistance against phosphinothricin was used as selectable marker. Embryogenic calli of sugarcane were bombarded with both expression cassettes and selected on regeneration medium supplemented with phosphinothricin. The phosphinothricin-resistant shoots were rooted and then, analyzed using molecular tools at the genomic as well as transcriptomic levels. The transcriptomic analysis, using real time qPCR, showed that expression of SUGARWIN1 (SWO) and SUGARWIN2 (SWT) was higher in transgenic plants as compared to untransformed plants. Our results further demonstrated that over expression of these genes under maize ubiquitin (Ubi-1) promoter causes significant restriction in proliferation of red rot causal agent, Colletotrichum falcatum in sugarcane transgenic plants, under in vitro conditions. This report may open up exciting possibilities to extend this technology to other monocots for the development of crops with better ability to withstand fungal pathogens. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The cellulosome is a highly efficient cellulolytic complex containing cellulolytic enzymes and non-catalytic subunits, i.e. scaffoldins, which are assembled by the interactions between the dockerin modules of the enzymes and the cohesin modules of the primary scaffoldins. The cellulosome attaches to the cell surface via the S-layer homology (SLH) modules of the anchoring scaffoldins. Clostridium thermocellum DSM1313 is a thermophilic cellulosome-producing bacterium with great potential in lignocellulose bioconversion and biofuel production. The bacterium contains four anchoring scaffoldins ScaB, ScaC, ScaD and ScaF, among which ScaF is the only one that contains an additional module of unknown function (ScaF-X) between the cohesin and SLH modules. The gene of ScaF is located outside the scaffoldin gene cluster of scaA, scaB, scaC and scaD. Previous studies showed unique regulation properties and function of ScaF compared to other anchoring scaffoldins, which might be related to the additional ScaF-X module. Here we report the NMR chemical shift assignments of ScaF-X from C. thermocellum DSM1313. The well-dispersed NMR spectrum and the secondary structure prediction based on the chemical shifts of ScaF-X indicated that ScaF-X is a well-folded protein module. The chemical shift assignments provide the basis for future studies on the structure of this module and its function in cellulosomes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In order to improve the performance of direct electron transfer-type electrode using multicopper oxidase (MCO), it is important to shorten the distance between the redox site of the enzyme and the electrode surface to increase electron transfer efficiency between enzyme and electrode. In this study, we focused on the mobility of the MCO from hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, immobilized onto electrode surface via an affinity tag at the MCO terminus. The mobility of the immobilized enzyme was controlled by changing the density of the immobilized enzyme on the electrode surface by altering the density of the linker for enzyme immobilization. The electrode with low density of MCO immobilized on electrode surface was improved swing ability of the enzyme. It showed 265% higher current density for electrochemical O2 reduction than that with high density of MCO immobilized on electrode surface. Biofuel cell using a cathode with a low density of MCO immobilized on the electrode showed 160% higher power density than a biofuel cell using a cathode with a high density of MCO immobilized on the electrode. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Pinene, a natural active monoterpene, is widely used as a flavoring agent, perfume, medicine, and biofuel. Although genetically engineered microorganisms have successfully produced pinene, to date, the biological yield of pinene is much lower than that of semiterpenes (isoprene) and sesquiterpenes (farnesene). In addition to the low heterologous expression of geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) and pinene synthase (PS), cytotoxicity due to accumulation of the monoterpene also limits the production of pinene in microorganisms. In this study, we attempted to use two strategies to increase the biological yield of pinene. By deleting the random coils of GPPS and PS alone or in combination, a strain with a 335% yield increase was obtained. Additionally, upon computer-guided molecular modeling and docking of GPPS with isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), its substrate, the key sites located within the catalytic pocket for substrate binding, was predicted. After screening, a strain harboring the T273R mutation of GPPS was selected among a batch of mutations of the key sites with a 154% increase in pinene yield. © 2021 Fei Chen et al.

AB  - Background: The objective of the present work was to investigate the influence of a pre-treatment of microbial-rich digestate (liquid mesophilic anaerobic digestate – AD-supernatant) on the morphology, crystallinity, and thermal stability of cellulose pulp fiber. Results: The six most abundant bacteria in the AD-supernatant were determined by 16S analysis. The bacteria population was comprised mostly of Bacteroides graminisolvens (66%) and Parabacteroides chartae (28%). Enzymatic activity from the bacteria partially removed the amorphous components and increased the crystallinity and crystallite size of the cellulose substrate. The fiber pulp was incubated in AD-supernatant for 5, 10, and 20 days. The X-ray diffraction data provided evidence that the amorphous portion of the cellulose was more readily and quickly hydrolyzed than the crystalline portion. The longest incubation times (20 days) resulted in substantial deconstruction of the cellulose fiber structure and decreased the thermal degradation temperature. Conclusion: The anaerobic digestate is inexpensive and could be used to effectively aid in the pretreatment of cellulose on large scale transformation processes, e.g. for making biofuels, cellulose micro/ nanofiber production or engineered fiber-based materials. © 2021, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - The agricultural sector is a major source of biomass feedstocks for biofuels. Even though biomass potential in Thailand has been analyzed on a national level, its distribution and potential have yet to be assessed on a regional and provincial scale. Therefore, the study aims to verify the possibility of decentralized second-generation bioethanol production from regionally available agricultural residues. Most of the generated residues stem from the country’s major crops (sugarcane, cassava, rice and palm), totaling 174.1 million tons per year. The volume of bioethanol from these residues is projected to be 20,213.5 million liters per year, meeting 31.2% of the overall fuel demand of the transport sector. At the regional level, the northeast produces the highest amount of bioethanol at 9099.7 million liters per year, followed by the central, northern and southern regions. In terms of provincial distribution, the highest amount of bioethanol is converted in Nakhon Ratchasima, amounting to 1328 million liters per year. Data from the top ten potential provinces suggest that decentralizing production facilities is possible. One of the hotspots is Surat Thani in the south which can potentially utilize palm residues as feedstocks. This regionalized assessment also found that conventional feedstocks could be substituted with regionally available residues in the 26 production plants currently in operation. The results confirm that there would be enough alternative regional feedstocks to meet existing production capacities and they indicate that there would be enough regional residues left over for future value-added utilization.

AB  - Open rice straw burning has created hazardous effects on the environment and human health. Biological pretreatment of rice straw has been proven as an environmental-benign and economical feasible process for the production of biofuels and value-added products under milder and greener conditions by avoiding harmful chemicals and toxic reagents. A consolidated bioprocess for the production of cellulolytic enzymes and biological pretreatment was developed to achieve a cost-effective saccharification of rice straw. Biodegradation of biomass was slightly enhanced with increase in cultivation time of microbial pretreatment. Furthermore, the modification in biomass due to biological pretreatment weakened the interaction between hemicellulose and lignin that resulted in significant reduction in lignin using Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis JJBS300, Myceliophthora thermophila BJTLRMDU3, and Aspergillus oryzae SBS50 for biological pretreatment of rice straw. Bacterial culture produced maximum FPase, CMCase, and β-glucosidase of 28, 17, and 20.36 U/g DMR after 2 days during pretreatment process, whereas M. thermophila produced maximum FPase (85.10 U/g DMR), CMCase (96.89 U/g DMR), and β-glucosidase (91.92 U/g DMR) after 9 days. The mold A.oryzae SBS50 also produced maximum FPase (57.41 U/g DMR), CMCase (55.36 U/g DMR), and β-glucosidase (48.04 U/g DMR) after 9 days of pretreatment. Maximum amount of reducing sugars of 52.41, 86.74, and 49.59 mg/g substrate were liberated from 6-, 5-, and 3-day-old biological pretreated rice straw by B. subtilis, M. thermophila, and A. oryzae, respectively, after enzymatic hydrolysis for 6 h at 60 oC and pH 5.0. Laccase-pretreated rice straw followed by enzymastic saccharification resulted in liberation of 162.82 mg/g reducing sugars at pH 5.0 and 60 °C after 6h using 20 U/g cellulase. Simultaneous laccase pretreatment and saccharification (SLPS) process further enhanced the liberated reducing sugars, i.e., 179.47 mg/g substrate. FTIR, XRD, and SEM analyses showed marked morphological changes as a result of delignification after biological pretreatment of rice straw. Biological pretreatment being an environmental-benign process causing no harm to the environment in comparison to physical and chemical pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass could be a better pretreatment strategy for bioremediation of lignocellulosic substrates. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Currently, due to the reduction of pollutant emissions from transport and the obligations arising from the RED II Directive, there is a great need to develop alternative solutions directly affecting the quantity and quality composition of advanced biofuels. The study evaluated the impact of acid, alkaline, and laccase treatment of sorghum biomass in obtaining lignocellulosic ethanol and optimized them. The effect of H2SO4, NaOH, and laccase on the value of reducing sugars and the chemical composition of the solid fraction before and after the treatment was determined. Sorghum biomass before and after the pretreatment was analyzed by FTIR spectra and SEM. Then, the SSF process was carried out and the ethanol yield per 100 g of sorghum biomass was determined. In summary, sorghum biomass was found to be an interesting and promising source for use in bioethanol production. It was found that alkaline and laccase treatment of sorghum biomass are effective methods and are based mainly on delignification. The advantage of biomass laccase treatment is the low energy demand, the use of relatively inexpensive equipment, and the production of pollutants with a low environmental burden. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Pistachio (pistacia vera L.) is a lignocellulosic raw material. One of the most pistachio produced three countries in the World is Turkey and Şanlıurfa is the city that most pistachio production in Turkey. As a result of this production, a large amount of pistachio waste is generated. Therefore, this study was conducted considering the abundant pistachio waste and furthermore, the effects of ozone and combined (ozone and hot water) pretreatments for bioethanol production from pistachio shells were investigated. Initially, the ozone and combined pretreatments were applied to the pistachio shells. It has been observed that applying the combined pretreatment provides better lignin removal than only ozone pretreatment and on the other hand, the ozone pretreatment provides better lignin removal than the hot water pretreatment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pretreated and untreated pistachio shells were compared. Enzyme activity was measured, and 30–60 FPU enzyme loading was applied in an enzymatic hydrolysis. The enzymatic hydrolysis was applied to obtain fermentable sugar from the pistachio shells after pretreatments. As a result of enzymatic hydrolysis, 2.34–8.24 g/L reducing sugar was obtained. On the other hand, 1.21–2.33 g/L ethanol concentration was obtained end of the fermentation process. Fermentation efficiency was calculated between 42% and 55%. As a result, this study showed that combined pretreatment was more effective than the single pretreatment in the ethanol production process. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable, clean-burning diesel replacement that can be used in existing diesel engines without modification. Biodiesel is among the nation’s first domestically developed and economically usable advanced biofuels. Throughout the field of biodiesel including FAME/FAGE diesel variants, the concentrations of close to around 20% conform to every requirement out from the existing fuel content guidelines. Larger blending ratios are essential for hydrotreated vegetable oil blends to lubricity enhancers. Of organic biobutanol blends, the suggested blending ratio is restricted to 10% or less to prevent high water content and low cetane content. Here, the presented survey intends to make a review of 65 papers that concerns with biodiesel blends. Accordingly, systematic analyses of the adopted techniques are carried out and presented briefly. In addition, the performances and related maximum achievements of each contribution are also portrayed in this survey. Moreover, the chronological assessment and various blends of biodiesel in the considered papers are reviewed in this work. Finally, the survey portrays numerous research problems and weaknesses that may be helpful for researchers to introduce prospective studies on biodiesel blends. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Pressing the biomass of sweet sorghum and sweet pearl millet in-field is one of thesuggested options for bioethanol production. The extracted juice can be delivered to an ethanolplant, and the bagasse (pressing residue) can be used for ruminant feeding. Efficient carbohydrateextraction is highly important for good ethanol yield. However, enough carbohydrates must remainin the bagasse for its adequate conservation as silage. In this study, the ensilability and thechemical composition of the second pressing bagasse of sweet sorghum and sweet pearl millet wereinvestigated. The bagasse was obtained following a second pressing of the first pressing bagasseafter its impregnation with water based on three water:bagasse ratios (0.5, 1, and 1.5). Resultsindicated that water:bagasse ratio did not affect water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) extraction forboth crops. The second pressing bagasse of sweet sorghum and sweet pearl millet contained 80.5±4.6 and 60 ±4.6 g of WSC kg-1 dry matter (DM), respectively. The second pressing bagasse of bothcrops had reduced nutritive value compared to the initial biomass, i.e., higher neutral detergentfiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) concentrations along with lower non-structuralcarbohydrate (NSC) concentration, in vitro true digestibility of DM (IVTD), and in vitro NDFdigestibility (NDFd). The second pressing bagasses of both crops also showed good ensilability, butsweet sorghum bagasse silages were of better nutritive value than sweet pearl millet bagasse silages(ADF = 446.2 ±3.7 vs. 463.2 ±3.7 g kg-1 DM, IVTD = 813.8 ±3.4 vs. 708.8 ±6.8 g kg-1 DM, andNDFd = 741.8 ±4.8 vs. 596.2 ±8.5 g kg-1 NDF, respectively). The water:bagasse ratio used forbagasse impregnation before the second pressing only affected the NDF concentration of silages, asa higher NDF concentration was obtained with a water:bagasse ratio of 1.5. Sweet sorghum andsweet pearl millet can be considered dual-purpose crops; the extracted juice can be fermented intoethanol, and the second pressing bagasse can be used to make good-quality silage. © 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cotton stalk (CS) was deconstructed by sequential dilute acid-alkali pretreatment (DALP) using sulfuric acid (1%, v/v) and sodium hydroxide (3%, w/v). The enzymatic hydrolysis of DALP-CS by cellulase was optimized by Taguchi method, employing factors like solid loading, enzyme dose, tween 80, and pH as main process variables. For bioethanol production, pretreated CS was subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using a newly identified yeast strain Kluyveromyces marxianus JKSG-6. RESULTS: Sequential pretreatment of CS resulted in 66% and 42% removal of hemicellulose and lignin, respectively. The same was evident from the changes in the fourier transforming infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy absorption spectrum. Under optimized conditions, the enzymatic hydrolysis of DALP-CS released 375.50 ± 0.04 mg g−1 of glucose. Further, by employing K. marxianus JKSG-6 under SSF at 42 °C, the strain produced an ethanol titer of 26.10 ± 0.05 g L−1 from pretreated CS. CONCLUSION: Sequential dilute acid-alkali pretreatment rendered CS, a highly recalcitrant LCB feedstock for bioethanol, more accessible for hydrolysis by cellulase. SSF of the effectively pretreated CS was successfully carried out for bioethanol production by employing a newly identified yeast K. marxianus JKSG-6. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

AB  - Nitrogen stress condition is believed to increase the production of lipid in microalgae, but the synthesis of both lipid and carbohydrate is less known. Therefore, the effect of nitrogen stress condition on the synthesis of lipid and carbohydrate of Tetradesmus obliquus UPSI-JRM02 was studied in a 2 L bioreactor system. The highest lipid and carbohydrate yields achieved under nitrogen stress condition were 37% and 23%, respectively. Nitrogen stress condition induced the accumulation of carbohydrate at early stage but started to reduce on day 4 when the carbon shifted towards lipid production. The fatty acid profile produced under nitrogen stress condition was composed of 54% polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), 43% saturated fatty acid (SFA) and 3% monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA). The biofuel properties of T. obliquus obtained under the nitrogen stress condition was within the range of biodiesel standard and is most suitable for the usage in cold country. © 2021 Penerbit UTM Press.

AB  - Bacteria that exhibit ionic-liquid (IL) tolerance are useful in chemical industries using renewable carbon sources pre-treated by ILs to produce biofuels and fine chemicals. An IL, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM]Cl), has a remarkable ability to solubilize wood components, whereas [BMIM]Cl inhibits the growth of various bacterial hosts useful for bioconversion. We previously isolated a 10% [BMIM]Cl-tolerant bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CMW1. Here we report novel mechanisms of tolerance to [BMIM]Cl in strain CMW1 and a novel major facilitator superfamily transporter coded by an ionic-liquid tolerance (ILT) gene. First, using CMW1 cells grown in the presence or absence of 10% [BMIM]Cl, whole-transcriptome analysis and differentially expressed gene analysis were performed. Probable mechanisms of tolerance to [BMIM]Cl include the uptake of osmoprotectants from the culture medium toward CMW1 cells and the export of [BMIM] cations that accumulated in CMW1 cells. The finding represents a first step in elucidation of the mechanisms of IL resistance in Gram-positive bacteria. Second, we conferred tolerance to 5% [BMIM]Cl on [BMIM]Cl-susceptible Brevibacillus choshinensis using ILT gene. This finding provides a notable basis for engineering IL-tolerant bacterial hosts that are applicable for the effective and sustainable production of industrially important chemicals. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The present review presents the most commonplace vegetable-based feedstock for biodiesel production. It focuses on biodiesel production with an emphasis on the most recent studies and innovations. Transesterification of plant oil or animal fat is the most common process for the production of biodiesel. Several techniques are utilized for this transesterification reaction, such as batch processes, ultrasonic, microwave and other methods. Many conditions are usually studied, including temperature, pressure, solvent and catalysis. Furthermore, we aim to provide an investigation of the different processes and technologies applicable to the production of second-generation biodiesel, with special attention paid to the development of innovative catalysts as well as new reactor concepts. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Cellulolytic enzymes have gained considerable importance as potential candidates for the efficient bioconversion of agricultural biomass into second-generation biofuel. This study aimed to improve cellulase production from a bacterial strain isolated from cow dung. The biochemical and molecular identification was performed, and the capacity of the isolated bacterium to hydrolyze sugarcane bagasse was also determined. Response surface methodology (RSM) and one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) designs were employed to maximize the cellulase production. The bacterium identified as Bacillus subtilis gave the highest cellulase yield at temperature of 45 °C, pH-7.0, and 72 h of incubation time. Optimization by the Plackett–Burman design consisting of 12 experimental runs at two levels of nine independent variables displayed the significant contribution of galactose (22%) and sodium nitrate (16%) in cellulase production. The responses in the form of contour and 3D plots (generated by Box-Behnken design) predicted maximum cellulase production with an activity of 0.8 U/mL/min in a medium containing 3.0 g/L carboxymethyl cellulose, 3.0 g/L galactose, 0.5 g/L sodium nitrate, 0.75 g/L KH2PO4, and 0.375 g/L MgSO4·7H2O. The experimentally deduced activity value was 0.698 U/mL/min, showing 90% validity of the predicted value and gave a threefold increase in cellulase production. The process adequately represented by the quadratic model (p &lt; 0.0343) for all the responses was significant. Results obtained show that optimization of fermentation medium favored the increased production of cellulase by the bacterium. The bacterial isolate B. subtilis CD001 was found to be a potential candidate to hydrolyze the lignocellulosic feedstock, sugarcane bagasse. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The biosynthesis of lipid-based biofuels is an important aspect of developing sustainable alternatives to conventional oils derived from fossil fuel reserves. Many biosynthetic approaches to biodiesel fuels and oils involve fatty acid derivatives as a precursor, and thioesterases have been employed in various strategies to increase fatty acid pools. Thioesterases liberate fatty acids from fatty acyl-coenzyme A or fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein substrates. The role played by thioesterases has not been extensively studied in model bacteria that accumulate elevated levels of biological oils based on fatty acid precursors. In this report, two primary thioesterases from the wax ester accumulating bacterium Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 were heterologously expressed, isolated and characterized. These genes were further analyzed at the transcriptional level in the native bacterium during wax ester accumulation, and their genes were disrupted to determine the effect these changes had on wax ester levels. Combined, these results indicate that these two thioesterases do not play an integral role in wax ester accumulation in this natural lipid-accumulating model bacterium. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - As an abundant biomass of surface water, water hyacinth was used as an input material to produce bioethanol in this study. Steam explosion and alkaline pre-treatment were applied on the material before simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process was carried out. Experimental data suggested the optimal enzyme dosage be 1.0 wt% of the dry mass of the biomass, and the mass of the material be up to 8.0 wt% of the whole mixture in a one-step loading procedure to obtain the climax efficiency after 78 h. The process does not need additional nitrogen nutrition, such as corn steep liquor (CSL), as those in other common lignocellulosic bioethanol processes, because water hyacinth itself contains much protein in its chemical composition. Protein content analysis showed that it was 17.2 wt% (on dry basis), similar to what reported in some published studies. The SSF efficiency was positively 72.8 % at the optimal conditions resulted out from the experiments. Such a convenient conversion of water hyacinth to bioethanol is not only meaningful in term of biofuel production but also in term of environmental treatment. Copyright © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Huge quantum of agricultural crop residue from agrarian economies like India is disposed of improperly by open land burning contributing to particulate and gaseous pollutants thereby severely impacting the environment and human health. There is an overwhelming need for sustainable utilization of this misplaced resource as feedstock in biofuel production through anaerobic digestion. Substrate composition influences the digestibility of the substrate and underlying microbial plasticity involved in anaerobic digestion. In this study, anaerobic inoculum was subjected to enrichment in the presence of agricultural residues with different lignin content whose influence on biogas production, and differential modulation/ reorganization of microbial communities was explored. BMP assay emphasized the inverse proportionality between lignin content and biogas yield, with highest biogas yield of 622 mL/g VS added in case of rice straw (lowest lignin, 16.9%), followed by wheat straw—556 mL/g VS (18.12% lignin), sugar cane leaves—451 mL/g VS (21.87% lignin), and lowest biogas yield of 411 mL/g VS added in case of cotton crop waste (highest lignin, 23.97%). Biogas production efficiency was correlated with the selection and shift of microbial communities to key hemicellulolytic (Bacteroides, Clostridium, Prevotella, Thermotoga, Cytophaga) and lignocellulolytic (Bacillus, Geobacter, Flavobacterium, Spirochaeta, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia) genotypes in comparison to initial anaerobic inoculum. Study highlighted that the variable lignin content resulted in genomic reorganization and created a scenario for high biogas production by selectively enriching different methanogenic pathways such as hydrogenotrophic pathways in rice straw metagenome (lowest lignin) and acetoclastic pathways in cotton crop waste metagenome (highest lignin). © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - To date, heavy metals present a main drawback for bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) performances. Therefore, our results confirm, for the first time, that Hansenulafabianii is an electrochemical active yeast that has a potential tolerance against various heavy metals. The bioreactor inoculated by Hansenula fabianii in mediatoless conditions provided a maximum current density of 32 mA/m2; up to 300 mA/m2 in the presence of methylene blue. In mediatorless conditions, cyclic voltammetry (CV) on a yeast pellet showed a single oxidative peak at 450mV and a pair peak, the CV of the supernatant confirmed that Hansenula fabianii secretedits own mediator. The obtained results proved that Hansenula fabianii based biofuel cell could be used for simultaneous current generation and heavy metal bioremediation. © 2021. The Authors.

AB  - Since environmental issues have become a priority for everyone on the planet, and the fact that growing demand for fossil fuels will soon lead to a reduction in world reserves, except for climate change due to their use and greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this work was to assess the potential for the introduction of biofuels and find the optimal conditions for the enzymatic hydrolysis of Japonica Rice husk. In addition, evaluate the positive and negative consequences because of the use and implementation of this technology. The methodology used variables: substrate FPU, pH, time, temperature and concentration surfactants using the screening construct obtained statistically, all variables are significant. Then an optimization plan was applied for the variables: pH, FPU and time, dropping those with a lower level of significance. Finally, the best conditions found in previous projects were (pH 5.0, 13 h, and 30 FPU/g of substrate); later, these conditions were applied in experiments to assess the effect of an increase in hydrolyzed cellulose. They use 6%; 8% and 10% of pulp is available with a recycling yield of 74%, 42% and 16%. The community has its own interests in the use of biofuels; therefore, this study provides an opportunity for biofuel producers to reduce environmental, economic, and social costs. © 2021, Econjournals.

AB  - This study investigates the influences of light-dark cycles and NaNO3 dose on Chlorella kessleri microalgal-specific growth rate (SGR), biomass productivity (P), and intracellular lipid productivity (LP) by using central composite design with desirability function. A single-objective optimization showed that the maximum SGR, P, and LP can be achieved as 0.487 day−1, 58.718 g/L day−1, and 14.252 mg/L day−1, respectively. The corresponding optimized light-dark cycle and NaNO3 loading were determined as 11.6/8.4 (h/h) and 15.54 g/L, 12/12 (h/h) and 16.23 g/L, and 12/12 (h/h) and 6.63 g/L, respectively. The multi-response optimization showed that the highest SGR of 0.359 day−1, biomass productivity of 50.663 g/L day−1 and LP of 14.114 mg/L day−1 can be accomplished at culture environments of 12/12 (h/h) light-dark cycles and 10.38 g/L NaNO3. These results suggest that the central composite design with desirability function-based technique is useful for design and operation of photobioreactors to produce lipid from microalgae. Analysis of variance was employed to explore the significance of the factors affecting microalgal growth as well as biomass and lipid productivities. The predicted optimized culture conditions were experimentally confirmed (error &lt; 6%) indicating the process is robust and reliable. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In current times, we heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels, which bring negative impacts on climate change; therefore, it is essential to place more focus on all renewable alternatives, especially bioenergy crops. This study is focused on the quantification and evaluation of biogas production from either corn or sweet sorghum, as well as their combination. The field data were obtained from 2013 to 2016 in central Ukraine. The Buswell equation was used for the calculation of the theoretical biogas and methane potential. The results show that corn and sweet sorghum were intercropping and had higher on 8.5–37.8% of green mass, and 9.5–28.7% estimated yield of biogas compared to the single use of these crops. Due to the higher dry matter content, the specific yield of biogas per unit of applied corn silage was higher by 33.7–50.6% compared to sweet sorghum. However, biogas yield was increased by 9.2–13.0% when using a mixture of corn silage and sweet sorghum compared to sweet sorghum alone. Results of biogas and methane yield per unit area show that the highest rates, 10.2 and 5.9 thousand m3/ha, were obtained in the combined growing of hybrids of sweet sorghum Dovista and corn Monica 350. Even though theoretical calculations have some limitations, the gathered results provide essential information on the potential of the examined green mass for biogas potential in Ukraine. Such information are crucial to be known for economic and energy reasons. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Functional screening of metagenomic libraries is an effective approach for identification of novel enzymes. A Caatinga biome goat rumen metagenomic library was screened using esculin as a substrate, and a gene from an unknown bacterium encoding a novel GH3 enzyme, BGL11, was identified. None of the BGL11 closely related genes have been previously characterized. Recombinant BGL11 was obtained and kinetically characterized. Substrate specificity of the purified protein was assessed using seven synthetic aryl substrates. Activity towards nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyrano-side (pNPX) and 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside (pNPC) suggested that BGL11 is a multifunctional enzyme with β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, and cellobiohydrolase activities. However, further testing with five natural substrates revealed that, although BGL11 has multiple substrate specificity, it is most active towards xylobiose. Thus, in its native goat rumen environment, BGL11 most likely functions as an extracellular β-xylosidase acting on hemicellulose. Biochemical characterization of BGL11 showed an optimal pH of 5.6, and an optimal temperature of 50°C. Enzyme stability, an important parameter for industrial application, was also investigated. At 40°C purified BGL11 remained active for more than 15 hours without reduction in activity, and at 50°C, after 7 hours of incubation, BGL11 remained 60% active. The enzyme kinetic parameters of Km and Vmax using xylobiose were determined to be 3.88 mM and 38.53 μmol.min-1.mg-1, respectively, and the Kcat was 57.79 s-1. In contrast to BLG11, most β-xylosidases kinetically studied belong to the GH43 family and have been characterized only using synthetic substrates. In industry, β-xylosidases can be used for plant biomass deconstruction, and the released sugars can be fermented into valuable bioproducts, ranging from the biofuel ethanol to the sugar substitute xylitol. © 2021 Souto et al.

AB  - Synthesis of 1,3- dioxane and 1,3-dioxolane, using sulfated CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst for acetalization of glycerol with benzaldehyde, is the focus of present work. SO42-/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst was synthesized using combustion method. Experiments were carried out to analyze the effect of various solvents (n-hexane, toluene, tert-butyl alcohol, pentanol), molar ratios (1:3, 1:5, 1:7), catalyst loadings (3 wt%, 5 wt%, 9 wt %) and temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C) on glycerol conversion and selectivity of the products. Selectivity of 87.20% dioxolane and 12.80% dioxane was obtained at molar ratio of 1:3, 9 wt% catalyst loading and temperature of 100 °C.Strong NH3 desorption peak from NH3-TPD study indicated the high acidic strength of sulphated catalyst. Strong surface acidity and surface porosity (observed from TEM and SEM analysis) contributed to an enhanced activity of the catalyst for glycerol acetalization reaction. The kinetics of the reaction was studied using an elementary kinetic law. A correlation coefficient of 0.98 from the selected kinetic model proved that the rate of acetalization reaction was dependent on glycerol concentration and acetal formation was instantaneous. The study demonstrated the application of an environmentally benign, inexpensive, thermally stable, active SO42-/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst for glycerol acetalization reaction to synthesize 1,3-dioxolane as the desired product. © 2021

AB  - Low biodegradability caused by polymeric structure is the main barrier in the use of lignocellulosic materials in biofuels production by using biological methods. Pretreatment of the biomass is the way to improve the suitability of hardly biodegradable biomass for biogas or bioethanol production. Evaluation of the influence of thermal and thermochemical alkaline pretreatment on the efficiency of hydrolysis of hay (mixture of various grass species) was the aim of the study. The batch scale experiment was carried out with the use of NaOH and distilled water as solvents, and the changes in pretreatment time (2, 4 and 8 hours) and temperature (22 and 80ºC) were also consid-ered. The efficiency of biomass solubilisation was assessed based on the results obtained from the measurements of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration in the hydrolysates. The solubility of the biomass, expressed as a percentage of soluble COD in total COD, was calculated. The experiment showed that the highest solubilisation of hay biomass was observed at 80ºC under alkaline conditions. In this case, the solubility of the COD was 3-times higher, and the VFA concentration in hydrolysates was 4-times higher in comparison to the distilled water-based test at 22ºC. It was noted that time of the process significantly influenced the efficiency of biomass solubilisation only during the experiment carried out at 22ºC. Extension of hydrolysis time from 2 to 8 hours increased the value of soluble COD of 70% and 55% for water and alkaline solvent, respectively. The process conducted at 80ºC was not time-dependent over the considered period. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Potential amylase enzymes have many industrial applications that are found in biological sources like animal, plants and microorganisms. Fungi and bacteria hold tremendous potential to produce the α-amylases using agriculture by-products under solid state fermentation (SSF). Agro-industrial residues such as rice bran, wheat bran, sugar cane bagasse, corn leaf, barley, orange peel, wheat straw, rice straw is abundant and cheapest carbon source. SSF using agro-industrial residues is currently used in a range of applications including classical applications such as antibiotics production, enzymes, composting, bio-surfactants and biofuel production. Microbial α-amylases have several applications in paper, food, pharmaceutical, detergent, and textile industries. The enzyme α-amylase is meritorious due to their properties such as thermostability, Ca2+-independent pH stability and pH profile which play important role in the development of bioprocess of different products. This review is focused on physiochemical properties of the bacterial α-amylases fermentation, structural and functional aspects of agro industrial residues and by products for α-amylase production. © 2021, University of Agriculture.

AB  - The obstacle to optimal utilization of biogas technology is poor understanding of biogas microbiomes diversities over a wide geographical coverage. We performed random shotgun sequencing on twelve environmental samples. Randomized complete block design was utilized to assign the twelve treatments to four blocks, within eastern and central regions of Kenya. We obtained 42 million paired-end reads that were annotated against sixteen reference databases using two ENVO ontologies, prior to β-diversity studies. We identified 37 phyla, 65 classes and 132 orders. Bacteria dominated and comprised 28 phyla, 42 classes and 92 orders, conveying substrate’s versatility in the treatments. Though, Fungi and Archaea comprised 5 phyla, the Fungi were richer; suggesting the importance of hydrolysis and fermentation in biogas production. High β-diversity within the taxa was largely linked to communities’ metabolic capabilities. Clostridiales and Bacteroidales, the most prevalent guilds, metabolize organic macromolecules. The identified Cytophagales, Alteromonadales, Flavobacteriales, Fusobacteriales, Deferribacterales, Elusimicrobiales, Chlamydiales, Synergistales to mention but few, also catabolize macromolecules into smaller substrates to conserve energy. Furthermore, δ-Proteobacteria, Gloeobacteria and Clostridia affiliates syntrophically regulate PH2 and reduce metal to provide reducing equivalents. Methanomicrobiales and other Methanomicrobia species were the most prevalence Archaea, converting formate, CO2(g), acetate and methylated substrates into CH4(g). Thermococci, Thermoplasmata and Thermoprotei were among the sulfur and other metal reducing Archaea that contributed to redox balancing and other metabolism within treatments. Eukaryotes, mainly fungi were the least abundant guild, comprising largely Ascomycota and Basidiomycota species. Chytridiomycetes, Blastocladiomycetes and Mortierellomycetes were among the rare species, suggesting their metabolic and substrates limitations. Generally, we observed that environmental and treatment perturbations influenced communities’ abundance, β-diversity and reactor performance largely through stochastic effect. Understanding diversity of biogas microbiomes over wide environmental variables and its’ productivity provided insights into better management strategies that ameliorate biochemical limitations to effective biogas production. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

AB  - The present study reports the partial purification and characterisation of a novel xylanase from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis JJBS250 followed by its applicability in the saccharification of rice straw. Bacterial xylanase was partially purified by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadax G-50 matrix that displayed optimal activity at 60 °C and pH 7.0 with half-life values of 1420 and 718 min at 60 °C and 80 °C, respectively. Bacterial xylanase showed high tolerance to ethanol with Km and Vmax values of 1.62 mg/ml and 23.92 U/ml, respectively, for beechwood xylan. Maximum amount of reducing sugars was obtained from sodium carbonate pretreated rice straw (151.65 mg/g substrate) as compared to untreated biomass (90.49 mg/g substrate) using 20 U/g enzyme dose at 60 °C and pH 7.0 after 48 h. Furthermore, the saccharification of pretreated rice straw was improved by synergistic action of bacterial and fungal xylanases. Analysis of rice straw using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy clearly showed the morphological changes and delignification in rice straw after pretreatment. Bacterial xylanase exhibiting novel properties including ethanol tolerance and high thermostability is highly suitable for the production of second generation biofuels in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process using lignocellulosic substrates. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) have excellent potential as components in bioelectronic devices, especially as active biointerfaces to regulate stem cell behavior for regenerative medicine applications. However, it remains unclear to what extent EBFC-generated electrical stimulation can regulate the functional behavior of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs) at the morphological and gene expression levels. Herein, we investigated the effect of EBFC-generated electrical stimulation on hAD-MSC cell morphology and gene expression using next-generation RNA sequencing. We tested three different electrical currents, 127 ± 9, 248 ± 15, and 598 ± 75 nA/cm2, in mesenchymal stem cells. We performed transcriptome profiling to analyze the impact of EBFC-derived electrical current on gene expression using next generation sequencing (NGS). We also observed changes in cytoskeleton arrangement and analyzed gene expression that depends on the electrical stimulation. The electrical stimulation of EBFC changes cell morphology through cytoskeleton re-arrangement. In particular, the results of whole transcriptome NGS showed that specific gene clusters were up-or down-regulated depending on the magnitude of applied electrical current of EBFC. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that EBFC-generated electrical stimulation can influence the morphological and gene expression properties of stem cells; such capabilities can be useful for regenerative medicine applications such as bioelectronic devices. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Bio-energy crops need to be grown on marginal salt and drought lands in India as per policy. Understanding environmental stress response in bio-energy crops might help in promoting cultivation of bio-energy feedstock on marginal salty and drought land. This is one of the first report for vegetative propagation of Bamboo (Bambusa balcooa) under salt and drought stress to understand antioxidant enzymes’ gene regulations to combat stress through activation of antioxidant enzymes and osmo-protectant molecules to scavenge reactive oxygen species as measured by physiological changes. Morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits were noted as indicators of plant health upon different sodium chloride (NaCl) salt-stress while various drought conditions with correlation analysis. A significant up-regulation of genes related to most of the antioxidant enzymes was observed up to salinity of 14 mS cm− 1 electric conductivity (EC) at 150 mM NaCl experimental salt stress which declined with higher salt-stress. While in the case of drought-stress, all genes remained up-regulated while proline dehydrogenase (PDH) remained down-regulated up-to 100% drought-stress having 4% soil moisture. The gene expressions of antioxidant enzymes were significantly correlated with their corresponding gene-products namely super-oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities. Biochemical parameters such as, soluble sugar, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), total amino acids, hydrogen peroxide and electrolyte leakage ratio also showed positive correlation (p = 0.001) with salt condition. Genetic and biochemical test parameters were significantly correlated with physiological attributes of plant health at soil EC of 14 mS cm− 1 shown as 150 mM NaCl salt stress and 60% drought-stress having 17% soil moisture content, were the optimum stress tolerance limits observed. Application of these data would be useful to cultivate 0.63 million ha of salinity affected land and 10.05 million ha of drought affected land among wastelands in India to meet biofuel need. © 2021, The Botanical Society of Japan.

AB  - The pretreatment of lignocellulosic material performed to improve substrate’s susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis is usually accompanied by reactions leading to the synthesis of compounds that inhibit the metabolic activity of microorganisms. Their toxicity is the main obstacle to the successful bioconversion of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. The identification of these inhibitors and the choice of the optimal detoxication method are crucial for the improving the efficiency of fermentation processes. Material rinsing with water after processing is a common detoxication practice. However, it generates material losses, thus affecting contents of saccharides in the fermentation medium, which may in turn trigger higher costs of lignocellulose conversion to ethanol and other products with a higher added value. A study was undertaken to determine the effect of selected methods for the detoxication of an enzymatic hydrolysate from Miscanthus giganteus on the fermentation efficiency of saccharide derivatives. The experiment conducted with Mucor rouxii DSM 1191 demonstrated the usability of the detoxication method based on the activated carbon. After 96-h fermentation of Miscanthus hydrolysates, the alcohol content in the post-reaction medium was higher by 14% than in the control experiment wherein the material was rinsed with water after pretreatment. The experiment carried out with Saccharomyces cerevisiae 7, NRRL 978 showed no positive impact of the alternative detoxication methods replacing material rinsing on the efficiency of ethanol synthesis. The highest concentration of this metabolite (2.04% (v/v)) was obtained in the experimental variant in which the mentioned operation was coupled with detoxication of hydrolysates using calcium hydroxide. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of agro-industrial waste as substrate to produce enzymes has been widely studied in order to adjust the high productions of these biocatalysts with a reduction of the final cost in an ecologically correct process in the industry. This is the first work to use peach-palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth.) waste for the production of carboxymethylcellulases (CMCase) by the Trichoderma stromaticum AM7 under solid-state fermentation (SSF) using the artificial neural network and genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) to optimize the cellulase production. ANN-AG was used to determine the optimal influence of nitrogen source concentration (2.46%), time (12 days), and temperature (26 °C) on the cellulase production with 98% of efficiency for algorithm prediction of endoglucanase activity. The predicted and experimental values of the CMCase activity in U/g of dry initial substrate (gds) were 122.9 and 120.0, respectively. After all optimization processes, the variation of these parameters allowed a final increase of 31.58-fold when compared to the initial fermentation. Moreover, the treatment of peach-palm waste with T. stromaticum AM7 endoglucanase had an effect on the degradation of the fibers analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and the saccharification of the waste by releasing reducing sugar (807.80 mg/g) for 8 h of incubation. These results are very promising to waste valorization and the biotechnological and industrial applications of cellulase of the T. stromaticum AM7 to food processes and biofuel production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Increased demand of fossil fuels, elevated amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has made the current situation alarming enough to opt for alternate solution to mitigate the current concerned condition. Microalgae are the new whims in providing solution to the worldwide challenges we are facing right now. New biotechnological tools integrated with the microalgal production in mass scale are the new answer to the current dispute. There are various conventional techniques to develop oil production from microalgae. However, owing to the time consuming and also high cost of production, gene editing technology provides a cost effective process in developing mass commercial production of biofuels. Among various gene editing technologies like transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), meganucleases, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) method have become new favourite among researchers. Due to flexible nature of editing ability in both reverse and forward mechanisms, easy adaptability, multiple target site accessibility and cost effectiveness, it has become a powerful arsenal in genetic engineering field to obtain desired results. With successful results, microalgae integrated with CRISPR/Cas9 method can be used as alternate source of energy to produce algal biofuels, pharmaceuticals and also other value added environment friendly products. CRISPR technique with a twist CRISPRi method is also a new technology which researchers are adapting due to its non-invading nature and ability to produce desired results in non-stress conditions. © 2021 World Research Association.

AB  - Leaf waste biomass of pineapple Ananas comosus can be used as the substrate for the second-generation biofuel production. The non-environmental friendly practice of pineapple leaf waste handling on the field can largely be avoided by directing the leaf waste as a feedstock for biofuels. In this study, three varieties of pineapple queen, simanchal (a local variety of India), and kew were used for the production of glucose. The leaf biomass of these pineapple varieties contained 19 to 22% extractives, 31 to 32% glucan, 17 to 22% hemicellulose, and 17 to 20% lignin. Biomass without any pre-treatment when digested with cellulase released 36 to 43% glucose, whereas glucose release percentages significantly elevated when the biomass was subjected to phosphoric acid-based cellulose solvent and organic solvent lignocellulose fractionation (COSLIF) pretreatment before hydrolysis. Herein, we found that cellulase enzyme dosages 5 filter paper unit (FPU) along with 10 international units (IU) of β-glucosidase per gram of glucan of COSLIF-pretreated leaf biomass of queen variety resulted in the generation of 84% glucose after 72 h of incubation. Assuming 100% conversion of glucose to ethanol, theoretical ethanol yield was calculated to be 212 L from 1 t dry leaf biomass.

AB  - In this study, Albizia saman bark hydrochar (ASB-HC) as a solid biofuel was generated by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). Response surface methodology (RSM) identified the importance of variables and their interactions to conduct the experiments. The effects of the reaction temperature (180–200 °C), residence time (2–4 h), and stirring speed (400–600 rpm) on ASB-HC yield (wt. %) and higher heating value (HHV) were analyzed and optimized for these factors and responses using the Box–Behnken design (BBD) of RSM. FTIR, TGA, SEM-EDX, and HHV analyses were done to characterize and understand the effects of HTC on Albizia saman bark (ASB-raw) and ASB-HC in an optimized state. In this optimized state, the carbonization temperature, residence time, and stirring speed were 180 °C, 4 h, and 600 rpm, respectively, with 69.89% yield and 18.59 MJ/kg HHV. The influence of temperature on hydrochar production compared to the time and stirring speed was evident in the investigation. The HHV of ASB-raw was 15.8 MJ/kg which increased to 18.59 MJ/kg at ASB-HC. The proximate and ultimate analysis revealed that ASB-HC had higher fixed carbon but there was less oxygen and volatile matter content than ASB-raw. The obtained activation energy indicated the slower reaction rate of hydrochar degradation. This investigation provides practical insights about hydrochar properties, process conditions, and thermal degradation kinetics on hydrothermal treatment for bark feedstock.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the genome sequence of Flammulina velutipes var. lupinicola based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and to identify the genes encoding car-bohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in the genome. The optimal assembly (71 kmer) based on ABySS de novo assembly revealed a total length of 33,223,357 bp (49.53% GC content). A total of 15,337 gene structures were identified in the F. velutipes var. lupinicola genome using ab initio gene prediction method with Funannotate pipeline. Analysis of the orthologs revealed that 11,966 (96.6%) out of the 15,337 predicted genes belonged to the orthogroups and 170 genes were specific for F. velutipes var. lupinicola. CAZymes are divided into six classes: auxiliary activities (AAs), glycosyltransferases (GTs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs), polysaccharide lyases (PLs), glycoside hydrolases (GHs), and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). A total of 551 genes encoding CAZymes were identified in the F. velutipes var. lupinicola genome by analyzing the dbCAN meta server database (HMMER, Hotpep, and DIAMOND searches), which consisted of 54–95 AAs, 145–188 GHs, 55–73 GTs, 6–19 PLs, 13–59 CEs, and 7–67 CBMs. CAZymes can be widely used to produce bio-based products (food, paper, textiles, animal feed, and biofuels). Therefore, information about the CAZyme repertoire of the F. velutipes var. lupinicola genome will help in under-standing the lignocellulosic machinery and in-depth studies will provide opportunities for using this fungus for biotechnological and industrial applications. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The municipal and agricultural wastes are promising source of ligniocellulosic biomasses (LBs) for bioethanol production. However, the pretreatment-hydrolysis (P–H) of LB is the most difficult process in bioethanol production due to high crystallinity of LB compositional structures. In this study, p-toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA) was investigated for P–H of multi-substrate (MS) sample of LBs. Five alternative MS samples were prepared from 10 single LBs. Based on the total reducing sugar yield, one of the MS was selected for optimization experiment. The factors affecting P–H (acid concentration, time and temperature) were optimized to compare catalytic activity of PTSA and H2SO4. Under the optimized conditions, maximum total reducing sugar (TRS) yield of 95.89 and 78.26% was obtained using PTSA and H2SO4, respectively. Mass production of hydrolysate was carried out using both catalysts at a substrate load of 50 g.L−1 and fermented at an optimum yeast load of 10% (v/v). The ethanol yield from the hydrolysates of PTSA treatment was 16.89 g L−1 (74.5%) and from H2SO4 was 13.17 g L−1 (70.9%) at 48 &amp; 56 h fermentation time, respectively. The PTSA surpassed the conventional method of treatment (H2SO4) both in TRS and ethanol yield. The efficiency of PTSA can be noticed in that one third of the acid concentration required in sulfuric acid treatment was used in PTSA to obtain 96% of TRS at lower temperature. This study revealed the potential of aqueous PTSA for the hydrolysis of a mixture of feedstocks which is much more complex and challenging than treating a single substrate. © 2020

AB  - The fabrication of bioelectrocatalytic protein electrodes by the simple compression of carbon nanotube and protein powders was investigated using a series of proteins including bilirubin oxidase (BOx), bovine serum albumin (BSA), catalase, cytochrome C (Cyt C), diaphorase, FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH), galactose oxidase (GAOx), glucose oxidase (GOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), laccase and urease. The isoelectric points (pI) of the proteins ranged from 3.5 to 12 and the molecular weights ranged from 12.4 to 480 kDa. The compression of diaphorase, laccase, BOx, FAD-GDH, catalase and urease gave mechanically stable biopellets in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4. For Cyt C, BSA, GAOx, GOx, and HRP, contact with buffer destabilised the biopellet and induced a fast destruction of the composite. In parallel, stable redox pellets were obtained with differently charged redox mediators: hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride, potassium hexacyanoferrate or 1,4-naphthoquinone. Several parameters were explored to shed new light on the factors that determine biopellet stability. Stable biopellets capable of direct and mediated electron transfer were subsequently elaborated, for O2 reduction and glucose oxidation, respectively, based on the simplified procedure that does not require stabilising protection membranes or holders on the contrary to existing methods. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The use of non-edible oils, waste oils, and animal fats have been investigated as a low-cost feedstock for biodiesel (fatty acid alkyl esters) synthesis. However, these alternative raw materials have some drawbacks due to the high content of free fatty acid (FFA). This work aimed to study the continuous enzymatic ethyl esters synthesis, in a solvent-free system, from the reaction of acid soybean oil (acid value, AV, of 0.5, 8.5, 50, and 90) and ethanol using a dual commercial immobilized lipase system (Novozym 435®, Lipozyme TL IM®, Lipozyme RM IM®). Initially, a dual lipase system was used in a single packed-bed reactor (PBR). The blend of Lipozyme TL IM and Novozym 435 had a positive synergistic effect on biodiesel synthesis: an increase of 76% in ethyl ester content was observed after 2 h using refined soybean oil. However, a reduction in the yield was observed in longer reaction times (25 h). Therefore, a continuous reaction system, operated with two different catalytic beds, was investigated. The use of two series reactors allowed high ethyl ester yield (>90%) and high acid conversion (>90%). The reaction using acid soybean oil (50 AV), and Lipozyme RM IM and Novozym 435 reached an ethyl ester content of 95% and 70% after 2 and 25 h, respectively. The results showed that using two different commercial immobilized lipases in intercalated packed-bed reactors enhanced biodiesel synthesis from acid soybean oil. The enzymatic system allows a high fatty acid conversion present in the acidic oil into ethyl ester. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Laccase mediated delignification of lignocellulosic biomass generates phenolic compounds which normally inhibits the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and suppresses the reaction rate drastically. To overcome the inhibitory effects and maximize productivity, pretreatment is requisite. This work proposes the extraction of phenolic compounds at the pretreatment stage to increase glucose yield in the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass-Bambusa Bamboo. In addition, recovery of lignin derived phenolic compounds is also targeted by adsorption followed by desorption. For adsorbent preparation, chemically modified cenospheres from waste coal fly ash and chitosan were cross-linked to form syntactic foam adsorbent. Adsorption and desorption studies were carried out on synthesized adsorbent using gallic acid as a phenolic equivalent. In our investigation, 40.31% delignification was achieved when the feed of the average particle size of 60 μm was operated in a batch reactor. The extraction of phenolic compounds significantly increases glucose yield and 1.4 times higher glucose yield was obtained for delignified plus extracted biomass than that of only delignified biomass. Syntactic foam adsorbent has shown excellent adsorption capacity for phenolic compounds with a rapid rate of adsorption in initial hours and exhibited maximum adsorption capacity as 1.07 mmol of gallic acid per gram of adsorbent. Thus, extraction of lignin derived phenolic inhibitors prior to enzymatic hydrolysis, and recovery of these phenolic compounds by adsorption can make the process more viable for the sustainable production of biofuels in the biorefinery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: Although temperature is a crucial factor affecting enzymatic activity on biochemical and biofuel production, the reaction temperature for the generation of these products is usually set at the optimal growth temperature of the host strain, even under non-proliferative conditions. Given that the production of fermentation products only requires a fraction of the cell’s metabolic pathways, the optimal temperatures for microbial growth and the fermentative production of a target compound may be different. Here, we investigated the effect of temperature on lactic and succinic acids production, and related enzymatic activities, in wild-type and succinic acid-overproducing strains of Corynebacterium glutamicum. Interestingly, fermentative production of lactic acid increased with the temperature in wild-type: production was 69% higher at 42.5 °C, a temperature that exceeded the upper limit for growth, than that at the optimal growth temperature (30 °C). Conversely, succinic acid production was decreased by 13% under the same conditions in wild-type. The specific activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase decreased with the increase in temperature. In contrast, the other glycolytic and reductive TCA cycle enzymes demonstrated increased or constant activity as the temperature was increased. When using a succinic acid over-producing strain, succinic acid production was increased by 34% at 42.5 °C. Our findings demonstrate that the profile of fermentation products is dependent upon temperature, which could be caused by the modulation of enzymatic activities. Moreover, we report that elevated temperatures, exceeding the upper limit for cell growth, can be used to increase the production of target compounds in C. glutamicum. Key points: • Lactate productivity was increased by temperature elevation. • Succinate productivity was increased by temperature elevation when lactate pathway was deleted. • Specific activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase was decreased by temperature elevation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Brassica rapa L. (AA; 2n = 20) store considerable amounts of oil and protein reserves in the seeds. Genetic enhancement of these seed storage products is sought to meet specific requirements of the producers and consumers of edible oils, biofuels, animal feed and other industrial products. This necessitates the introduction of new genetic variation and a greater understanding of the trait genetics. We tested 195 germplasm lines of B. rapa for oil, protein and glucosinolates under the environment conditions differing for day length and ambient temperatures during development and maturation of the seeds. This helped to document phenotypic variations for these traits and also identify accessions with extreme phenotypes. DArT genotyping and genome wide association studies enabled detection of SNP markers within or near the genes that are associated directly or indirectly with the biosynthesis of oil (LTPG5, FRK7, SSE1, LACS8, LTPG33), protein (VTI1B, TSB2, SESA4, bZIP1, PPI1, K18J17.13) and glucosinolates (IMD1, MYB119, ILR3, IQD1, ADS2, SOT18). We also envisaged a gene, PLAT2. It is a member of PLAT-plant-stress subgroup of proteins. PLAT2 can be a target for breeding efforts aimed at improving abiotic stress tolerance. Introduction of novel allelic diversity may be more desirable for the development of designer genotypes rather than the simple repackaging of the genetic variation extant in the crop gene pools. It is for the first time that an attempt has been made to characterize allelic diversity extant in the ‘A’ sub genome of B. juncea for its deployment in B. rapa genepool. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Clostridium autoethanogenum, the bacterial model for biological conversion of waste gases into biofuels, grows under extreme carbon-monoxide (CO) concentrations. The strictly anaerobic bacterium derives its entire cellular energy and carbon from this poisonous gas, therefore requiring efficient molecular machineries for CO-conversion. Here, we structurally and biochemically characterized the key enzyme of the CO-converting metabolism: the CO-dehydrogenase/Acetyl-CoA synthase (CODH/ACS). We obtained crystal structures of natively isolated complexes from fructose-grown and CO-grown C. autoethanogenum cultures. Both contain the same isoforms and if the overall structure adopts the classic α2β2 architecture, comparable to the model enzyme from Moorella thermoacetica, the ACS binds a different position on the CODH core. The structural characterization of a proteolyzed complex and the conservation of the binding interface in close homologs rejected the possibility of a crystallization artefact. Therefore, the internal CO-channeling system, critical to transfer CO generated at the C-cluster to the ACS active site, drastically differs in the complex from C. autoethanogenum. The 1.9-Å structure of the CODH alone provides an accurate picture of the new CO-routes, leading to the ACS core and reaching the surface. Increased gas accessibility would allow the simultaneous CO-oxidation and acetyl-CoA production. Biochemical experiments showed higher flexibility of the ACS subunit from C. autoethanogenum compared to M. thermoacetica, albeit monitoring similar CO-oxidation and formation rates. These results show a reshuffling of internal CO-tunnels during evolution of these Firmicutes, putatively leading to a bidirectional complex that ensure a high flux of CO-conversion toward energy conservation, acting as the main cellular powerplant. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Lignocellulose is an abundant substrate for biogas production; however, for efficient utilization, proper pre-treatment is required to enhance the biomethane yield and hydrolysis rate significantly. Phenolic compounds from dissolved lignin, produced during alkali pre-treatment, have inhibitory effects on the anaerobic digestion; however, the possible inhibitory effects of solid lignin have not gathered enough interest. Especially, the effect of solid lignin on methanogenesis remains a knowledge gap. In this study, kraft lignin was used as a model solid lignin substrate for its co-digestion with microcrystalline cellulose. A new approach of modelling biomethane production curves using smoothing splines was developed to describe the long-term inhibitory effects of solid lignin on hydrolysis and methanogenesis. The method gives possibility to describe long-term inhibitory effects by using batch instead of continuous test data. Results revealed that kraft lignin showed mild inhibitory effects on methanogens. However lignin impact combined with volatile fatty accumulation can prolong hydrolysis and reactor recovery start-up by 47.3% and 75.3%, respectively. For small dosages of solid lignin adaptation of methanogens is possible. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the effects of the addition of micro- (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo) and macro-(Sulfur) nutrients on mono-digestion of sorghum under mesophilic conditions. A continuous stirred-tank reactor was operated for more than 420 days under seven different experimental conditions. The experimental results showed poor performance for methane production and process stability without nutrient supplementation. Serious deficiencies in Co and S were confirmed by nutrient analysis of dry sorghum and digestate. Nutrient augmentation efficiently enhanced methane production and volatile fatty acid (VFA) removal. Methane production reached 223 mL-CH4/g-VS, almost matching the yield predicted by biochemical methane potential (BMP) test. S was demonstrated to have a critical effect on metal availability in the digester. Consequently, to maintain stable methane fermentation, suitable supplementations of S and Co are recommended for anaerobic sorghum mono-digestion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We have used the single-pulse shock tube technique with postshock GC/MS product analysis to investigate the mechanism and kinetics of the unimolecular decomposition of isopropanol, a potential biofuel, and of its reaction with H atoms at 918-1212 K and 183-484 kPa. Experiments employed dilute mixtures in argon of isopropanol, a radical scavenger, and, for H-atom studies, two different thermal precursors of H. Without an added H source, isopropanol decomposes in our studies predominantly by molecular dehydration. Added H atoms significantly augment decomposition, mainly by abstraction of the tertiary and primary hydrogens, reactions that, respectively, lead to acetone and propene as stable organic products. Traces of acetaldehyde were observed in some experiments above ≈ 1100 K and establish branching limits for minor decomposition pathways. To quantitatively account for secondary chemistry and optimize rate constants of interest, we employed the method of uncertainty minimization using polynomial chaos expansions (MUM-PCE) to carry out a unified analysis of all datasets using a chemical model–based originally on JetSurF 2.0. We find: k(isopropanol → propene + H2O) = 10(13.87 ± 0.69) exp(−(33 099 ± 979) K/ T) s−1 at 979-1212 K and 286-484 kPa, with a factor of two uncertainty (2σ), including systematic errors. For H atom reactions, optimization yields: k(H + isopropanol → H2 + p-C3H6OH)= 10(6.25 ± 0.42) T2.54 exp(−(3993 ± 1028) K /T) cm3 mol−1 s−1 and k(H + isopropanol → H2 + t-C3H6OH)= 10(5.83 ± 0.37) T2.40 exp(−(1507 ± 957) K /T) cm3 mol−1 s−1 at 918-1142 K and 183-323 kPa. We compare our measured rate constants with estimates used in current combustion models and discuss how hydrocarbon functionalization with an OH group affects H abstraction rates. Published 2020.

AB  - Abstract: α-Amylase is the major biocatalyst involved in saccharification process of starch-based biofuel production. Most of the α-amylases reported in literature are not stable and catalytically active in presence of metabolites (biosolvents, and bioacids), and other media components such as salts and reducing agents, hence starch-based biofuels are produced by two-step process of separate hydrolysis by α-amylase, and later the fermentation of biofuel production. Finding new α-amylase with special properties can assist to integrate the process of saccharification and biofuel fermentation. We report a new α-amylase produced from wild type Bacillus strain IBT108. This α-amylase (10.5 U/ml) can be produced from wheat bran (5%) based medium. It can be purified by diethylaminoethyl weak anion exchange-based fast protein liquid chromatography. Purified α-amylase has molecular mass of 68 kDa with a high specific activity (734.8 U/mg), and significant Vmax (1428.6 U/mg) and Km (2.8 mg/ml). Protein fingerprinting analysis reveals that it is a unique member of super-families of AmyAc and MaltAmyC which can act on both α-1,4 and α-1,6-glycosidic linkages of starch. It shows optimal activity at pH 7 and 70 °C, retains 72–92% of its activity in acidic pH range between 4 and 6.5, and stable at 60 °C for 2 h. Notably, it is resistant to 5 mM concentration of urea, dithiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, surfactants and EDTA, also shows &gt; 70% of its activity in presence of 1 M solvents. Consequently, adding this α-amylase (2.5–3 U/ml) assists Clostridia to effectively utilize 375 g/l waste potato, and produce high concentration of butanol (20.41–23.74 g/l) and hydrogen (3.20–4.38 l/l).

AB  - In order to improve the sedimentation performance of biogas slurry and reduce the COD, microwave-enhanced advanced oxidation process (MW/H2O2-AOP) was used to pretreat the cow manure biogas slurry. A laboratory-scale microwave reactor was used to strengthen the H2O2 advanced oxidation process to achieve the solid–liquid separation of biogas slurry which was difficult to be settled. The results showed that the maximum COD removal efficiency reached 68.8% when pH, H2O2/total solid, microwave time and microwave power were 3, 0.4, 5 min and 300 W, respectively. COD was reduced from 24,157 mg/L to 7536 mg/L, and the settlings volume was reduced to 38%, while other pollutants such as the total solid and total dissolved solid were significantly reduced. Total solid and total dissolved solid removal efficiency reached 50.0% and 62.0%, respectively. Since no other agents were added, MW/H2O2-AOP can effectively reduce secondary pollution and reduce the cost of treatment. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Current research on bioalcohol production focuses mainly on the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass such as agricultural wastes. Biological degradation of lignocellulosic biomass requires investigation of microorganisms that can efficiently degrade all the components including lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose for biofuel applications. Hence a natural consortium capable of producing multiple enzymes for effective degradation of lignocellulosic biomass without pre-treatment is preferred over individual microbes. In the current study, natural consortia from the degraded wood sample were chosen to analyse the microbial community using Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology. The cellulolytic and solventogenic properties of the consortia were analysed. Enzyme assays confirmed the endoglucanase, xylanase, beta-glucosidase activities of the consortia. Fermentation experiments with glucose, CMC and cellulose produced acetone, ethanol, butanol and isopropanol with a total solvent concentration of 5.15 g L−1, 0.40 g L−1 and 0.41 g L−1, respectively. Total solvent production increased between 0.505 g L−1 and 0.541 g L−1 when the initial pH of the media was adjusted to 6.0 with CMC and cellulose, respectively. However, media supplemented with 5 g L−1 glucose and 20 g L−1 cellulose produced 3.92 g L−1 total solvent. 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed the presence of Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium butyricum, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus humi in consortia isolated from the degraded wood sample. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cellulase production studies were conducted with Talaromyces verruculosus IIPC 324 under solid state fermentation (SSF), and optimal parameters were conclusively selected via saccharification of acid-pretreated sugarcane bagasse. Various physicochemical parameters affecting cellulase production under SSF were optimized. Endoglucanase and cellobiase production responded differently under individual growth conditions. Maximum endoglucanase and cellobiase activity of ≥ 250 U/g and ≥ 45 U/g respectively was obtained when the strain was grown at 24°C for 4 days with an initial moisture content of 62.5% on wheat bran supplemented with 1.62% ammonium chloride. The enzyme cocktail obtained from these optimized growth conditions yielded 8.37 ± 0.75 g L−1 reducing sugar from acid-pretreated sugarcane bagasse after 72 h at 60°C and pH 4.0. With the addition of Avicel PH-101 at 5% concentration in wheat bran, the cellulase cocktail of Talaromyces verruculosus IIPC 324 released 9.17 ± 0.60 g L−1 and 7.82 ± 0.06 g L−1 of total reducing sugars and glucose respectively at 60°C (pH 4.0) after 72 h. The addition of glucose and other simple sugars did not repress the cellulase production under SSF conditions, making Talaromyces verruculosus IIPC 324 an attractive candidate for cellulase production and its application for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Succinic acid (SA) is a crucial metabolic intermediate and platform chemical. Development of biobased processes to achieve sustainable SA production has attracted more and more attention in biotechnology industry. Yarrowia lipolytica has a strong tricarboxylic acid cycle and tolerates low pH conditions, thus making it a potential platform for SA production. However, its SA titers in glucose media remain low. Results: In this study, we screened mitochondrial carriers and C4-dicarboxylic acid transporters to enhance SA secretion in Y. lipolytica. PGC62-SYF-Mae strain with efficient growth and SA production was constructed by optimizing SA biosynthetic pathways and expressing the transporter SpMae1. In fed-batch fermentation, this strain produced 101.4 g/L SA with a productivity of 0.70 g/L/h and a yield of 0.37 g/g glucose, which is the highest SA titer achieved using yeast, with glucose as the sole carbon resource. Conclusion: Our results indicated that transporter engineering is a powerful strategy to achieve the efficient secretion of SA in Y. lipolytica, which will promote the industrial production of bio-based SA. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Salix (willow) species represent an important source of bioenergy and offer great potential for producing biofuels. Salix spp. like many hardwoods, produce tension wood (TW) characterized by special fibres (G-fibres) that produce a cellulose-rich lignin-free gelatinous (G) layer on the inner fibre cell wall. Presence of increased amounts of TW and G-fibres represents an increased source of cellulose. In the present study, the presence of TW in whole stems of different Salix varieties was characterized (i.e., physical measurements, histochemistry, image analysis, and microscopy) as a possible marker for the availability of freely available cellulose and potential for releasing d-glucose. Stem cross sections from different Salix varieties (Tora, Björn) were characterized for TW, and subjected to cellulase hydrolysis with the free d-glucose produced determined using a glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) assay. Effect of cellulase on the cross sections and progressive hydrolysis of the G-layer was followed using light microscopy after staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: Tension wood fibres with G-layers were developed multilaterally in all stems studied. Salix TW from varieties Tora and Björn showed fibre G-layers were non-lignified with variable thickness. Results showed: (i) Differences in total % TW at different stem heights; (ii) that using a 3-day incubation period at 50 °C, the G-layers could be hydrolyzed with no apparent ultrastructural effects on lignified secondary cell wall layers and middle lamellae of other cell elements; and (iii) that by correlating the amount of d-glucose produced from cross sections at different stem heights together with total % TW and density, an estimate of the total free d-glucose in stems can be derived and compared between varieties. These values were used together with a literature value (45%) for estimating the contribution played by G-layer cellulose to the total cellulose content. Conclusions: The stem section-enzyme method developed provides a viable approach to compare different Salix varieties ability to produce TW and thus freely available d-glucose for fermentation and biofuel production. The use of Salix stem cross sections rather than comminuted biomass allows direct correlation between tissue- and cell types with d-glucose release. Results allowed correlation between % TW in cross sections and entire Salix stems with d-glucose production from digested G-layers. Results further emphasize the importance of TW and G-fibre cellulose as an important marker for enhanced d-glucose release in Salix varieties. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Bioproduction of renewable chemicals is considered as an urgent solution for fossil energy crisis. However, despite tremendous efforts, it is still challenging to generate microbial strains that can produce target biochemical to high levels. Here, we report an example of biosynthesis of high-value and easy-recoverable derivatives built upon natural microbial pathways, leading to improvement in bioproduction efficiency. By leveraging pathways in solventogenic clostridia for co-producing acyl-CoAs, acids and alcohols as precursors, through rational screening for host strains and enzymes, systematic metabolic engineering-including elimination of putative prophages, we develop strains that can produce 20.3 g/L butyl acetate and 1.6 g/L butyl butyrate. Techno-economic analysis results suggest the economic competitiveness of our developed bioprocess. Our principles of selecting the most appropriate host for specific bioproduction and engineering microbial chassis to produce high-value and easy-separable end products may be applicable to other bioprocesses. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Presence of inhibitory chemicals in lignocellulose hydrolysates is a major hurdle for production of second-generation bioethanol. Especially cheaper pre-treatment methods that ensure an economical viable production process generate high levels of these inhibitory chemicals. The effect of several of these inhibitors has been extensively studied with non-xylose-fermenting laboratory strains, in synthetic media, and usually as single inhibitors, or with inhibitor concentrations much higher than those found in lignocellulose hydrolysates. However, the relevance of individual inhibitors in inhibitor-rich lignocellulose hydrolysates has remained unclear. Results: The relative importance for inhibition of ethanol fermentation by two industrial second-generation yeast strains in five lignocellulose hydrolysates, from bagasse, corn cobs and spruce, has now been investigated by spiking higher concentrations of each compound in a concentration range relevant for industrial hydrolysates. The strongest inhibition was observed with industrially relevant concentrations of furfural causing partial inhibition of both D-glucose and D-xylose consumption. Addition of 3 or 6 g/L furfural strongly reduced the ethanol titer obtained with strain MD4 in all hydrolysates evaluated, in a range of 34 to 51% and of 77 to 86%, respectively. This was followed by 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, acetic acid and formic acid, for which in general, industrially relevant concentrations caused partial inhibition of D-xylose fermentation. On the other hand, spiking with levulinic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid or vanillin caused little inhibition compared to unspiked hydrolysate. The further evolved MD4 strain generally showed superior performance compared to the previously developed strain GSE16-T18. Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of individual inhibitor evaluation in a medium containing a genuine mix of inhibitors as well as the ethanol that is produced by the fermentation. They also highlight the potential of increasing yeast inhibitor tolerance for improving industrial process economics. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: A single-step ethanol production is the combination of raw cassava starch hydrolysis and fermentation. For the development of raw starch consolidated bioprocessing technologies, this research was to investigate the optimum conditions and technical procedures for the production of ethanol from raw cassava starch in a single step. It successfully resulted in high yields and productivities of all the experiments from the laboratory, the pilot, through the industrial scales. Yields of ethanol concentration are comparable with those in the commercial industries that use molasses and hydrolyzed starch as the raw materials. Results: Before single-step ethanol production, studies of raw cassava starch hydrolysis by a granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme, StargenTM002, were carefully conducted. It successfully converted 80.19% (w/v) of raw cassava starch to glucose at a concentration of 176.41 g/L with a productivity at 2.45 g/L/h when it was pretreated at 60 °C for 1 h with 0.10% (v/w dry starch basis) of Distillase ASP before hydrolysis. The single-step ethanol production at 34 °C in a 5-L fermenter showed that Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fali, active dry yeast) produced the maximum ethanol concentration, pmax at 81.86 g/L (10.37% v/v) with a yield coefficient, Yp/s of 0.43 g/g, a productivity or production rate, rp at 1.14 g/L/h and an efficiency, Ef of 75.29%. Scale-up experiments of the single-step ethanol production using this method, from the 5-L fermenter to the 200-L fermenter and further to the 3000-L industrial fermenter were successfully achieved with essentially good results. The values of pmax,Yp/s, rp, and Ef of the 200-L scale were at 80.85 g/L (10.25% v/v), 0.42 g/g, 1.12 g/L/h and 74.40%, respectively, and those of the 3000-L scale were at 70.74 g/L (8.97% v/v), 0.38 g/g, 0.98 g/L/h and 67.56%, respectively. Because of using raw starch, major by-products, i.e., glycerol, lactic acid, and acetic acid of all three scales were very low, in ranges of 0.940–1.140, 0.046–0.052, 0.000–0.059 (% w/v), respectively, where are less than those values in the industries. Conclusion: The single-step ethanol production using the combination of raw cassava starch hydrolysis and fermentation of three fermentation scales in this study is practicable and feasible for the scale-up of industrial production of ethanol from raw starch. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The production of microalgal biofuels, despite their sustainable and renowned potential, is not yet cost-effective compared to current conventional fuel technologies. However, the biorefinery concept increases the prospects of microalgal biomass as an economically viable feedstock suitable for the co-production of multiple biofuels along with value-added chemicals. To integrate biofuels production within the framework of a microalgae biorefinery, it is not only necessary to exploit multi-product platforms, but also to identify optimal microalgal cultivation strategies maximising the microalgal metabolites from which biofuels are obtained: starch and lipids. Whilst nutrient limitation is widely known for increasing starch and lipid formation, this cultivation strategy can greatly reduce microalgal growth. This work presents an optimisation framework combining predictive modelling and experimental methodologies to effectively simulate and predict microalgal growth dynamics and identify optimal cultivation strategies. Results: Microalgal cultivation strategies for maximised starch and lipid formation were successfully established by developing a multi-parametric kinetic model suitable for the prediction of mixotrophic microalgal growth dynamics co-limited by nitrogen and phosphorus. The model’s high predictive capacity was experimentally validated against various datasets obtained from laboratory-scale cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CCAP 11/32C subject to different initial nutrient regimes. The identified model-based optimal cultivation strategies were further validated experimentally and yielded significant increases in starch (+ 270%) and lipid (+ 74%) production against a non-optimised strategy. Conclusions: The optimised microalgal cultivation scenarios for maximised starch and lipids, as identified by the kinetic model presented here, highlight the benefits of exploiting modelling frameworks as optimisation tools that facilitate the development and commercialisation of microalgae-to-fuel technologies. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cellulose synthase (CESA) mutants have potential use in straw processing due to their lower cellulose content, but almost all of the mutants exhibit defective phenotypes in plant growth and development. Balancing normal plant growth with reduced cellulose content remains a challenge, as cellulose content and normal plant growth are typically negatively correlated with one another. Result: Here, the rice (Oryza sativa) semi-dominant brittle culm (sdbc) mutant Sdbc1, which harbors a substitution (D387N) at the first conserved aspartic acid residue of OsCESA9, exhibits lower cellulose content and reduced secondary wall thickness as well as enhanced biomass enzymatic saccharification compared with the wild type (WT). Further experiments indicated that the OsCESA9D387N mutation may compete with the wild-type OsCESA9 for interacting with OsCESA4 and OsCESA7, further forming non-functional or partially functional CSCs. The OsCESA9/OsCESA9D387N heterozygous plants increase salt tolerance through scavenging and detoxification of ROS and indirectly affecting related gene expression. They also improve rice straw return to the field due to their brittle culms and lower cellulose content without any negative effects in grain yield and lodging. Conclusion: Hence, OsCESA9D387N allele can improve rice salt tolerance and provide the prospect of the rice straw for biofuels and bioproducts due to its improved enzymatic saccharification. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Baker’s yeast is a widely used eukaryotic cell factory, producing a diverse range of compounds including biofuels and fine chemicals. The use of lignocellulose as feedstock offers the opportunity to run these processes in an environmentally sustainable way. However, the required hydrolysis pretreatment of lignocellulosic material releases toxic compounds that hamper yeast growth and consequently productivity. Results: Here, we employ CRISPR interference in S. cerevisiae to identify genes modulating fermentative growth in plant hydrolysate and in presence of lignocellulosic toxins. We find that at least one-third of hydrolysate-associated gene functions are explained by effects of known toxic compounds, such as the decreased growth of YAP1 or HAA1, or increased growth of DOT6 knock-down strains in hydrolysate. Conclusion: Our study confirms previously known genetic elements and uncovers new targets towards designing more robust yeast strains for the utilization of lignocellulose hydrolysate as sustainable feedstock, and, more broadly, paves the way for applying CRISPRi screens to improve industrial fermentation processes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Woody plants with high glucose content are alternative bioresources for the production of biofuels and biochemicals. Various pretreatment methods may be used to reduce the effects of retardation factors such as lignin interference and cellulose structural recalcitrance on the degradation of the lignocellulose material of woody plants. Results: A hydrogen peroxide-acetic acid (HPAC) pretreatment was used to reduce the lignin content of several types of woody plants, and the effect of the cellulose structural recalcitrance on the enzymatic hydrolysis was analyzed. The cellulose structural recalcitrance and the degradation patterns of the wood fibers in the xylem tissues of Quercus acutissima (hardwood) resulted in greater retardation in the enzymatic saccharification than those in the tracheids of Pinus densiflora (softwood). In addition to the HPAC pretreatment, the application of supplementary enzymes (7.5 FPU cellulase for 24 h) further increased the hydrolysis rate of P. densiflora from 61.42 to 91.94% whereas the same effect was not observed for Q. acutissima. It was also observed that endoxylanase synergism significantly affected the hydrolysis of P. densiflora. However, this synergistic effect was lower for other supplementary enzymes. The maximum concentration of the reducing sugars produced from 10% softwood was 89.17 g L−1 after 36 h of hydrolysis with 15 FPU cellulase and other supplementary enzymes. Approximately 80 mg mL−1 of reducing sugars was produced with the addition of 7.5 FPU cellulase and other supplementary enzymes after 36 h, achieving rapid saccharification. Conclusion: HPAC pretreatment removed the interference of lignin, reduced structural recalcitrance of cellulose in the P. densiflora, and enabled rapid saccharification of the woody plants including a high concentration of insoluble substrates with only low amounts of cellulase. HPAC pretreatment may be a viable alternative for the cost-efficient production of biofuels or biochemicals from softwood plant tissues. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Casbene synthase (CS) is responsible for the first committed step in the biosynthesis of phorbol esters (PE) in the Euphorbiaceae. PE are abundant in the seeds of the biofuel crop Jatropha curcas and its toxicity precludes the use of the protein-rich cake obtained after oil extraction as an animal feed and the toxicity of the fumes derived from burning PE containing biofuel is also a matter of concern. This toxicity is a major hindrance to exploit the potential of this crop as a source of raw material to produce biodiesel. For this reason, the current research on J. curcas is mainly focused on the understanding of the biosynthesis and site of synthesis of PE, as an avenue for the development of genotypes unable to synthesize PE in its seeds. Results: Here, we present targeted proteomics assays (SRM and PRM) to detect and quantify CS in leaves, endosperm, and roots of two J. curcas genotypes with contrasting levels of PE. These assays were based on the use of reference isotopic labeled synthetic peptides (ILSP) predicted from 12 gene models of CS from the J. curcas genome. Conclusion: Our targeted proteomics methods were able to detect and quantify, for the first time, CS gene products and demonstrate the distribution of CS isoforms only in roots from J. curcas genotypes with a high and low concentration of PE. These methods can be expanded to monitor CS, at the protein level, in different tissues and genotypes of J. curcas. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw, an agricultural waste of high yield, is a sustainable source of fermentable sugars for biofuel and other chemicals. However, it shows recalcitrance to microbial catalysed depolymerization. We herein describe development of thermotolerant microbial consortium (RSV) from vermicompost with ability to degrade rice straw and analysis of its metagenome for bacterial diversity, and lignocellulolytic carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) and their phylogenetic affiliations. RSV secretome exhibited cellulases and hemicellulases with higher activity at 60 °C. It catalysed depolymerization of chemical pretreated rice straw as revealed by scanning electron microscopy and saccharification yield of 460 mg g−1 rice straw. Microbial diversity of RSV was distinct from other compost habitats, with predominance of members of phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes; and Pseudoclostridium, Thermoanaerobacterium, Chelatococcus and Algoriphagus being most abundant genera. RSV harboured 1389 CAZyme encoding ORFs of glycoside hydrolase, carbohydrate esterase, glycosyl transferase, carbohydrate binding module and auxiliary activity functions. Microorganisms of Firmicutes showed central role in lignocellulose deconstruction with importance in hemicellulose degradation; whereas representatives of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes contributed to cellulose and lignin degradation, respectively. RSV consortium could be a resource for mining thermotolerant cellulolytic bacteria or enzymes and studying their synergism in deconstruction of chemically pretreated rice straw. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Microalgae have attracted considerable interest due to their ability to produce a wide range of valuable compounds. Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) has been demonstrated to effectively disrupt the microalgae cells and facilitate intracellular extraction. To increase the commercial viability of microalgae, the entire biomass should be exploited with different products extracted and valorized according to the biorefinery scheme. However, demonstrations of multiple component extraction in series are very limited in literature. This study aimed to develop an effective lipid extraction protocol from wet Scenedesmus almeriensis after PEF-treatment with 1.5 MJ·kgDW−1. A cascade process, i.e., the valorization of several products in row, was tested with firstly the collection of the released carbohydrates in the water fraction, then protein enzymatic hydrolysis and finally lipid extraction. Biomass processed with high pressure homogenization (HPH) on parallel, served as benchmark. Results: Lipid extraction with ethanol:hexane (1:0.41 vol/vol) offered the highest yields from the different protocols tested. PEF-treatment promoted extraction with almost 70% of total lipids extracted against 43% from untreated biomass. An incubation step after PEF-treatment, further improved the yields, up to 83% of total lipids. Increasing the solvent volume by factor 2 offered no improvement. In comparison, extraction with two other systems utilizing only ethanol at room temperature or elevated at 60 °C were ineffective with less than 30% of total lipids extracted. Regarding cascade extraction, carbohydrate release after PEF was detected albeit in low concentrations. PEF-treated samples displayed slightly better kinetics during the enzymatic protein hydrolysis compared to untreated or HPH-treated biomass. The yields from a subsequent lipid extraction were not affected after PEF but were significantly increased for untreated samples (66% of total lipids), while HPH displayed the lowest yields (~ 49% of total lipids). Conclusions: PEF-treatment successfully promoted lipid extraction from S. almeriensis but only in combination with a polar:neutral co-solvent (ethanol:hexane). After enzymatic protein hydrolysis in cascade processing; however, untreated biomass displayed equal lipid yields due to the disruptive effect of the proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, the positive impact of PEF in this scheme is limited on the improved reaction kinetics exhibited during the enzymatic hydrolysis step. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Both APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) superfamily and R2R3-MYB family were from one of the largest diverse families of transcription factors (TFs) in plants, and played important roles in plant development and responses to various stresses. However, no systematic analysis of these TFs had been conducted in the green algae A. protothecoides heretofore. Temperature was a critical factor affecting growth and lipid metabolism of A. protothecoides. It also remained largely unknown whether these TFs would respond to temperature stress and be involved in controlling lipid metabolism process. Results: Hereby, a total of six AP2 TFs, six ERF TFs and six R2R3-MYB TFs were identified and their expression profiles were also analyzed under low-temperature (LT) and high-temperature (HT) stresses. Meanwhile, differential adjustments of lipid pathways were triggered, with enhanced triacylglycerol accumulation. A co-expression network was built between these 18 TFs and 32 lipid-metabolism-related genes, suggesting intrinsic associations between TFs and the regulatory mechanism of lipid metabolism. Conclusions: This study represented an important first step towards identifying functions and roles of AP2 superfamily and R2R3-MYB family in lipid adjustments and response to temperature stress. These findings would facilitate the biotechnological development in microalgae-based biofuel production and the better understanding of photosynthetic organisms’ adaptive mechanism to temperature stress. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Nearly a fourth of all enzymatic activities is attributable to oxidoreductases, and the redox reactions supported by this vast catalytic repertoire sustain cellular metabolism. In many biological processes, reduction depends on hydride transfer from either reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or its phosphorylated derivative (NADPH). Despite longstanding efforts to regenerate NADPH by various methods and harness it to support chemoenzymatic synthesis strategies, the lack of product purity has been a major deterrent. Here, we demonstrate that a nanostructured heterolayer Ni–Cu2O–Cu cathode formed by a photoelectrochemical process has unexpected efficiency in direct electrochemical regeneration of NADPH from NADP+. Remarkably, two-thirds of NADP+ was converted to NADPH with no measurable production of the inactive (NADP)2 dimer and at the lowest reported overpotential [− 0.75 V versus Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) reference]. Sputtering of nickel on the copper-oxide electrode nucleated an unexpected surface morphology that was critical for high product selectivity. Our results should motivate design of integrated electrolyzer platforms that deploy this heterogeneous catalyst for direct electrochemical regeneration of NADH/NADPH, which is central to design of next-generation biofuel fermentation strategies, biological solar converters, energy-storage devices, and artificial photosynthesis. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a non-biodegradable pollutant that has become a global threat due to its bioaccumulation and biomagnification in higher trophic levels of the food chain. Green technologies such as phycoremediation is an emerging approach and possess edge over conventional methods to remediate Cd from the environment. The present investigation elucidates the adaptive mechanism of a freshwater microalga, Scenedesmus sp. IITRIND2 under Cd stress. The microalga showed excellent tolerance to Cd stress with IC50 value of ~32 ppm. The microalga showed phenomenal removal efficiency (~80%) when exposed to 25 ppm of Cd. Such a high uptake of Cd by the cells was accompanied with increased total lipid content (~33% of dry cell weight). Additionally, the elevated level of ROS, lipid peroxidation, glycine-betaine, and antioxidant enzymes evidenced the activation of efficient antioxidant machinery for alleviating the Cd stress. Further, analysis of the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) presented a steady increase in saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids with biodiesel properties complying the American and European fuel standards. The study proposes an integrated approach for bioremediation of toxic Cd using hyper-tolerant microalgal strains along with biodiesel production from the generated algal biomass. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sludge palm oil is a by-product produced as a result of oil loss into waste streams during the palm oil milling process. It is non-edible, inexpensive and abundantly available, thus making it an attractive feedstock for biodiesel production. However, it contains high contents of water and free fatty acids, rendering the conventional alkali-catalyzed process unsuitable. Therefore, this research aimed to improve the production of biodiesel from sludge palm oil using a low-cost liquid lipase (Eversa® Transform 2.0) produced from a genetically modified Aspergillus oryzae. The activity of the liquid lipase was determined to be 9600 IU mL−1. We performed the reaction using low-input process conditions with only 0.2 wt% enzyme concentration and 5:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio at a low operating temperature of 45 °C. Under an optimum stirring speed of 750 rpm, a crude biodiesel with a high ester content of approximately 94 wt% could be produced. Additionally, the crude glycerol produced has a higher purity compared to that produced via a chemical-catalyzed process. Overall, an economical and sustainable enzymatic process for the conversion of sludge palm oil into high quality biodiesel and glycerol has been demonstrated in this study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to growing topicality of indirect land use change, greater shift towards second generation biofuels should be observed. In order to help smaller biogas and bioethanol producers, multi-criteria analysis of lignocellulose pre-treatment is conducted to elucidate the most preferable approach for lignocellulose pre-treatment. There are four main pre-treatment groups - biological, chemical, physical and physochemical pre-treatment. In this article three pre-treatment types were described by highlighting their specific approaches; using multi-criteria analysis a conclusion was reached that the most preferable pre-treatment option for lignocellulose biomass like corn stover or sugarcane is microbiological pre-treatment, as it showed the closest proximity to ideal solution. © 2020 Ilze Vamza et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

AB  - The use of willow plantations can be a sustainable approach for treating primary municipal wastewater, potentially reducing both the environmental and economic burdens associated with conventional treatment. However, the impact of wastewater irrigation upon the willow biorefinery potential has not yet been established. To investigate this effect, three-year-old field grown willows were harvested from plots kept as either controls or irrigated with primary municipal wastewater effluent at 29.5 million L ha−1 yr−1. Biomass compositional analysis, ionic liquid pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification were assessed and differential abundance of persistent extractable phytochemicals was evaluated using untargeted metabolite profiling. Glucan significantly increased by 8% in wastewater treated trees, arabinose and galactose were significantly decreased by 8 and 29%, respectively, while xylose, mannose and lignin content were unaltered. Ionic liquid pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification efficiencies did not vary significantly, releasing &gt;95% of the cell wall glucose and recovering 35% of the lignin. From a total of 213 phytochemical features, 83 were significantly depleted and 14 were significantly enriched due to wastewater irrigation, including flavonoids and lignan derivatives. Considered alongside increased biomass yield from wastewater irrigation (+200%), lignocellulosic bioenergy yields increased to 8.87 t glucose ha−1 yr−1 and 1.89 t ha−1 yr−1 recovered lignin, while net extractives yields increased to 1.48 t ha−1 yr−1, including phytochemicals of interest. The maintenance of glucose accessibility after low-cost ionic liquid pretreatment is promising evidence that sustainable lignocellulose bioenergy production can complement wastewater treatment. Untargeted metabolite assessment revealed some of the phytochemical toolkit employed by wastewater irrigated willows, including accumulation of flooding and salinity tolerance associated flavonoids glabraoside A and glabrene. The extractable phytochemicals underpin a novel high biomass phenotype in willow and, alongside lignocellulosic yields, could help enhance the economic feasibility of this clean wastewater treatment biotechnology through integration with sustainable biorefinery. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Cardoon is low-input biomass which can be efficiently exploited in the modern biorefinery for multi-purpose uses. In this work, cardoon lignocellulosic stalks underwent to acid-catalyzed steam explosion. A design of experiments approach was employed to assess the effect of the process variables (acid concentration, temperature and reaction time) on xylan recovery after direct hydrolysis and cellulose digestibility in the enzymatic hydrolysis step. According to the statistical model generated, the optimal conditions to maximize overall monosaccharides yield were 166 °C, 1.45% (w/w) and 10 min. A monosaccharides production and inhibitors formation of 36.76 g/100 g raw material (close to 70% of the maximal theoretical yield) and 1.80 g/100 g raw material, respectively, were achieved. The scale-up of the hydrolysis step showed superior performance of the washed solid fraction than to the whole slurry, resulting in cellulose conversion to glucose by 76% vs 58%. By employing the life cycle assessment approach, it was possible to determine the environmental impact in terms of the global warming potential (3.18 kgCO2eq/kg of fermentable carbohydrates) and cumulative energy demand (43.34 MJ/kg of fermentable carbohydrates). The low-inhibitor and high-sugar hydrolysate can be fermented to biochemicals and biofuels without any detoxification process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study comprehensively explored underlying mechanism of fed-batch culture on product biosynthesis in Chromochloris zofingiensis by dynamic model, targeted metabolite determination, enzyme activity analysis, and 13C tracer-based metabolic flux analysis. Based on dynamic models of cell growth and product formation, exponential fed-batch culture and fed-batch culture based on pH changes were established to increase biomass concentration by 20.05-fold and 18.28-fold, respectively. Exponential fed-batch culture exhibited great potentials in biodiesel and protein productions from microalgae. Systematic metabolic tools revealed fed-batch culture limited photosynthetic efficiency by inhibiting photosystem and Rubisco activity, while strengthened respiratory action to provide more substances and energy for product biosynthesis. Fed-batch culture elevated biosynthetic capability for carotenoid and lipid by promoting related metabolic flux and contents of pyruvate and ace-CoA. Finally, economic analysis revealed biomass cost was decreased to 1.99 $/kg from 2.39 $/kg, suggesting fed-batch culture was a cost-effective strategy to improve economic viability of microalgal production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To decrease the cost of biodiesel production, undeveloped nonedible Semen Abutili seed oil (SASO) was first used as a feedstock to prepare biodiesel. Some low-cost liquid lipases were screened and used as green catalysts for biodiesel production via the ethanolysis of SASO. The effect of reaction factors on ethanolysis was optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM). The results demonstrated that SASO was a promising alternative feedstock, and Eversa® Transform 2.0 showed the best performance for biodiesel production from low-quality SASO feedstock (high FFA and phospholipid contents). In addition, Eversa® Transform 2.0 can be reused 3 times without significant loss. The influence of reaction factors on biodiesel yield decreased in the order of reaction temperature &gt; lipase load &gt; reaction time. The maximum biodiesel yield was 94.2 ± 1.3 % under the optimal conditions (lipase load 6%, water content 20 %, 7:1 (mol/mol) ethanol to SASO, 11 h, 37 °C). The kinetic parameters (Vmax and K'm) of the transesterification of SASO were 4.16 × 10−2mol/(L∙min) and 5.27 × 10-1 mol/L, respectively. The Arrhenius equation and activation energy, Ea, of Eversa® Transform 2.0-catalyzed transesterification of SASO were lnV0 = 4.8252–2382.3/T and 19.80 kJ/mol, respectively. The biodiesel produced from SASO was accordance with the ASTM D6751 standard, except for the oxidation stability. Thus, SASO, an undeveloped nonedible low-quality vegetable oil, can be used as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production, and the low-cost liquid lipase Eversa® Transform 2.0 can be used for biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The automotive industry is directly affected by the shortage of fossil fuels and the excessive pollution resulting from crude oil-based fuels has many adverse effects on the environment. The search for a greener and sustainable source of materials and fuels to power automobiles has ultimately led to the usage of biomass and biobased sources as the main precursor due to its graft availability and renewability. Biobased fuels developed have been shown to easily blend in with the existing automobile engines and to provide sustainable performance. Similarly, the usage of various biobased polymers, plastics, and composite materials as the structural materials for the construction of automobiles instead of crude oil sources have shown to be invaluable. The powering of automobiles with electricity is the future of the transportation industry to address the greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels. Hence, biobased lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors have started to enter the mid-sized automotive industry. However, extensive commercialization of biobased products application in the automotive sector is underdeveloped. Hence it is customary to assess the various drawbacks of using biobased materials and identify the correct pathway for new research and development in this field. Therefore, this review covers various applications of biobased products in the automotive industries and mentions the active researches going on in this field to replace petroleum and crude oil-based sources with biobased sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) have been proposed as a reliable power source for implantable biomedical devices because of their sustainability and biocompatibility. However, the limited reactant concentration in vivo and concerns about bioelectrode fouling and leaking have largely restricted the methods of assembling EBFCs and resulted in unsatisfactory performance. In this study, we design a novel enzymatic slurry bioanode wrapped by a dialysis membrane in which enzymes, electron mediators and nanomaterials are dispersed instead of immobilized on an electrode. Notably, a novel two-dimensional metal carbide nanomaterial, Ti3C2 MXene, is adopted for the first time in EBFCs as a large surface area and highly conductive nanosheet. Using the MXene-based slurry bioanode, a maximum power density of about 320 μW cm−2 and a maximum current density of 2.1 mA cm−2 are generated under flow conditions with phosphate buffer solution containing 5 mM glucose at 25 °C. In addition, a long-term continuous discharge for about 20 days is achieved with a 5 μA discharge current. This prototype is promising for the implantation and longtime operation of EBFCs in vivo. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Globally, 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) were generated in 2016, about 37% of which was disposed of into landfills. This study evaluates the environmental and financial viability of producing ethanol from autoclaved MSW via fermentation. Experimental screening of four different microorganisms (i.e., S. cerevisiae, Z. mobilis, E. coli, and S. pombe) and process modelling indicate that MSW-derived ethanol can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline (84% reduction following EU Renewable Energy Directive accounting methodology, and by 156–231% reduction following the US Energy Independence and Security Act methodology). Utilisation of wastes for biofuel production in the UK benefits from policy support and financial support for renewable fuels (Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates). Financial analysis highlights that microorganisms achieving higher ethanol yield and productivity (S. cerevisiae and Z. mobilis) can achieve financial viability with higher cumulative net present value than E. coli, S. pombe. However, the positive net present value can be achieved primarily due to the benefit of gate fees received by diverting wastes to autoclave and ethanol production (64% of total revenues), rather than from revenues from ethanol sales (7% of total revenues). Key process improvements must be achieved to improve the financial viability of ethanol production from MSW and deliver a clear advantage over waste incineration, specifically improving hydrolysis yield, reducing enzyme loading rate and, to a lesser extent, increasing solid loading rate. The results provide significant insights into the role of policy and technology development to achieve viable waste-to-biofuel systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the advent of global industrialisation and adaptation of smart life there is rise in anthropogenic pollution especially in water. Remediation of the pollutants (such as metals, and dyes) present in industrial effluents is possible via microbes and algae present in the environment. Microbes are used in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) for remediation of various organic and inorganic pollutants. However, for industrial scale application coupling the MFCs with photocatalytic and photoelectric fuel cell has a potential in improving the output of power. It can also be used for remediation of pollutants more expeditiously, conserving fossil fuels, cleaning environment, hence making the coupled hybrid fuel cell to run economically. Furthermore, such MFC inbuilt with algae in living or powder form give additional value addition products like biofuel, polysaccharides, biopolymers, and polyhydroxy alkanoates etc. This review provides bird's eye view on the removal of environmental pollutants by different biological sources like bacteria and algae. The article is focussed on diatoms as potential algae since they are rich source of crude oil and high value added products in a hybrid photocatalytic MFC. It also covers bottle necks, challenges and future in this field of research. © 2021

AB  - The non-covalent modification of carbon nanotube electrodes with pyrene derivatives is a versatile approach to enhance the electrical wiring of enzymes for biosensors and biofuel cells. We report here a comparative study of five pyrene derivatives adsorbed at multi-walled carbon nanotube electrodes to shed light on their ability to promote direct electron transfer with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for H2O2 reduction. In all cases, pyrene-modified electrodes enhanced catalytic reduction compared to the unmodified electrodes. The pyrene N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester derivative provided access to the highest catalytic current of 1.4 mA cm−2 at 6 mmol L−1 H2O2, high onset potential of 0.61 V vs. Ag/AgCl, insensitivity to parasitic H2O2 oxidation, and a large linear dynamic range that benefits from insensitivity to HRP “suicide inactivation” at 4–6 mmol L−1 H2O2. Pyrene-aliphatic carboxylic acid groups offer better sensor sensitivity and higher catalytic currents at ≤ 1 mmol L−1 H2O2 concentrations. The butyric acid and NHS ester derivatives gave high analytical sensitivities of 5.63 A M−1 cm−2 and 2.96 A M−1 cm−2, respectively, over a wide range (0.25–4 mmol−1) compared to existing carbon-based HRP biosensor electrodes. A bacterial nanocellulose pyrene-NHS HRP bioelectrode was subsequently elaborated via “one-pot” and “layer-by-layer” strategies. The optimised bioelectrode exhibited slightly weaker voltage output, further enhanced catalytic currents, and a major enhancement in 1-week stability with 67% activity remaining compared to 39% at the equivalent electrode without nanocellulose, thus offering excellent prospects for biosensing and biofuel cell applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant and sustainable feedstock available globally. As a source of the polysaccharides, cellulose and hemicellulose, it can be converted into biofuels and other platform chemicals. This article highlights some important aspects that needs to be focused upon for the commercial development of lignocellulosic biorefineries. Although, lignocellulosic biomass offers clear value in terms of its green advantages and sustainability, there has been very low commercial success at industrial production levels. This can be attributed to a few key factors such as an irregular biomass supply chain, inefficient or complex pre-treatment and saccharification technologies, and scale up challenges leading to high capital and operating expenditures. Moreover, techno-economic studies performed on lignocellulosic biorefineries have revealed that process complexity is the most detrimental factor prohibiting scale-up. Although there have been several research efforts funded both by the public and private sectors, biomass valorization into biofuels and chemicals remains a technical and economical challenge. This review examines the global drivers towards the advancements of lignocellulosic biorefineries, technical and operational challenges for industrialization and future directions towards overcoming them. © 2021

AB  - Macroalgal biomass is currently considered as a potential candidate for biofuel production. In this study, the effects of pretreatment method and heat shock protein overexpression were investigated for efficient butanol production from Saccharina japonica using engineered Clostridium tyrobutyricum. First, various pretreatment methods including acid hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis and enzymatic saccharification, and ultrasonic-assisted acid hydrolysis were employed to obtain the fermentable sugars, and the resulted hydrolysates were evaluated for butanol fermentation. The results showed that ultrasonic-assisted acid hydrolysate obtained the highest butanol yield (0.26 g/g) and productivity (0.19 g/L⋅h). Then, the effects of homologous or heterologous heat shock protein overexpression on butanol production and tolerance were examined. Among all the engineered strains, Ct-pMA12G exhibited improved butanol tolerance and enhanced butanol production (12.15 g/L butanol with a yield of 0.34 g/g and productivity of 0.15 g/L⋅h) from 1.8-fold concentrated S. japonica hydrolysate, which was the highest level ever reported for macroalgal biomass. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bamboo is a fast-growing perennial plant rich at lignocellulose convertible for biofuels and biochemical production. Despite various physical and chemical pretreatments have been implemented for bamboo biomass utilization, it becomes essential to explore optimal technology for complete biomass saccharification to maximize bioethanol production in the desirable bamboo substrates. In this study, the steam explosion followed with optimized green-liquor pretreatments were conducted in different-year-old bamboo samples using response surface methodology. Compared to the older samples, the one-year-old bamboo (PhY1) showed a complete biomass enzymatic saccharification with hexoses yield of 100.0% (% cellulose), leading to the highest bioethanol yield of 20.3% (% dry biomass) achieved among all previously-reported bamboo processes. Notably, those combined pretreatments could not only cause an effective co-extraction of hemicellulose-lignin complexes, but also distinctively modify major wall polymer features (cellulose DP and accessibility, hemicellulosic Xyl/Ara and lignin S/G) for significantly reduced lignocellulose recalcitrance, which should lead to an integrated enhancement to biomass enzymatic saccharification in the PhY1 bamboo sample. Therefore, this study has demonstrated a powerful strategy for a green-like biomass process, providing an applicable technology to achieve maximum bioethanol production in bamboo and other lignin-rich bioenergy crops. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Flavonoid O-methylation is an essential change reaction in plants. Because of their strict substrate specificity, O-methyl transferases that catalyze development of small molecule in plants play a decisive role in the determination of secondary metabolite biosynthesis trajectories. O-methylation is now an important part of a wide range of biological and pharmacological roles in the variety of flavonoids. In the process of regulating proteins and producing plant volatile methyl esters research has in particular been focused on their natural functions. Alkylating agents have declined to be used in industrial biotechnology as MTs replace them. In the production of products like biofuels, bioplastics and medicines, chemicals processing technology was employed. These tissues, especially in the adipose tissues, are often methylated. This review shows that a group of enzymes potentially valuable for gene expression in citrus species and other plant species. © 2021

AB  - Magnetic mesoporous solid acid catalysts, designed as Fe3O4@SBA-15@HPW and Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW, were prepared for the production of biodiesel by the transesterification of palm oil with methanol. The magnetic mesoporous carrier was modified by two different methods: post-gifting method and impregnation method. The structure of the catalysts was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, VSM, Pyridine-FT-IR, N2 adsorption-desorption and TGA. The results indicated that they all had ordered mesoporous and excellent paramagnetic. Both Fe3O4@SBA-15@HPW and Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW had high content of Brønsted acid sites due to the loading of 12-tungstophosphoric acid, which made the two catalysts very active. Particularly, Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW was very efficient in the transesterification of palm oil with methanol and gave a more than 91% biodiesel yield when the reaction was carried out at 150 °C with a 4 wt% catalyst amount at 20:1 methanol/oil molar ratio for 5 h Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW prepared by the grafting method exhibited higher reusability, and the yield of biodiesel was more than 80% after 6 times cycles, which made the catalyst have an excellent industrial application prospect. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants are particularly challenging with the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge produced from the treatment units due to its high costs and environmental hazards. In this study, a biogas recirculation-driven anaerobic digestion (AD) system was developed with upward shear force being provided by biogas recirculation coupled with the alkali addition strategy, targeting biogas upgrading, sludge stabilization, and sludge flocculation simultaneously, thus reducing the sludge management costs. Compared to the conventional AD system, the novel biogas recirculation-driven AD system could achieve biogas upgrading with 10% higher CH4 content. Besides, the combination of NaOH and Ca(OH)2 addition strategy obviously improved sludge settleability and dewaterability compared to the single NaOH addition strategy. Owing to the attraction between negatively charged sludge particles and Ca2+ ions, the available Ca2+ in the former AD system may facilitate the re-flocculation and P immobilization in solid digestate, fix partial CO2 with less CO2 emission, and bridge with some sludge flocs. Moreover, 12.6% lower net cost for sludge management was achieved by this biogas recirculation-driven AD system together with the combination alkali addition strategy, which is regarded as a promising integrated multi-purpose system for sludge treatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, a flexible self-powered biosensor system integrated with the diaper was reported to detect the composition of urine. The system was powered by an enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC), which used the glucose in urine as fuel to generate electricity. The EBFC was assembled in a diaper and connected with a power management system (PMS) possessing a capacitor as an energy storage device to drive a light emitting diode (LED) flashing. The frequency of LED flicker was proportional to the charging speed of the capacitor, which was determined by the generated power of EBFC. Therefore, the flashing of LED enabled to indicate the glucose concentration in urine when someone was wearing the diaper with EBFC. The biosensor system composed of EBFC, PMS and LED, was a self-powered sensor system without external power and enabled to detect the glucose level in urine of diabetic patients. In the process of experiment, the power density of EBFC could be up to 220 μWcm−2 in 5 mM glucose solution. In the range of 1–5 mM, the flashing frequency of LED was proportional to the glucose concentration (r = 0.994). Uric acid and carbamide were added to the sensor as interferences, and the results showed that it had good anti-interference ability. Obviously, the self-powered biosensor hold the potential application to warn the urine glucose level of diabetic patients with urinary incontinence. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to specifically depolymerise lignin moieties without the loss of carbohydrates as well as to minimize the generation of harmful intermediates during the process is a major challenge in the biofuel production process. In the present study, a nanoparticle mediated pretreatment strategy was developed to specifically depolymerise lignin from corn cob biomass. The synthesized nanoparticles possessed unique enzyme mimicking characteristics that can be exploited for the deconstruction of lignin moieties. The maximum delignification was 44% using cerium doped iron oxide nanoparticles within 24 h of incubation time, at 25 °C and a high solid loading of 20% (w/v). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry study revealed the production of various lignin degraded compounds in pretreated liquids such as fatty acid methyl esters, which are the major components of fuel biodiesel. Aromatic alcohols and aldehydes were also observed during lignin degradation that has industrial importance. The remaining pretreated solid residues rich in carbohydrates can be further utilized in the generation of reducing sugars and in turn biofuels such as bioethanol, biobutanol, and biohydrogen. The value of the crystallinity index increased from 0.39 to 0.46 by delignification, indicating a total increase in biomass crystallinity. Moreover, the increase in biomass porosity indicates good biomass digestibility and in turn high reducing sugar yield. After enzymatic hydrolysis of 50 g L-1 pretreated biomass, 18.1 g L-1 of glucose and 9.12 g L-1 of xylose were released at 24 h, while the control (untreated biomass) showed a negligible amount of sugar release after hydrolysis. The recovery of nanoparticles after delignification was almost 50% of the initial concentration. The recovered catalyst was further recycled and reused, providing 37.1% delignification in the second run and 30.8% in the third run. Therefore, the obtained results in the current study substantiate the feasibility of the employed enzyme mimicking nanoparticles in the process of lignin degradation and fermentable sugar release in an eco-friendly manner. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Plant biomass-based biofuels have gradually substituted for conventional energy sources thanks to their obvious advantages, such as renewability, huge quantity, wide availability, economic feasibility, and sustainability. However, to make use of the large amount of carbon sources stored in the plant cell wall, robust cellulolytic microorganisms are highly demanded to efficiently disintegrate the recalcitrant intertwined cellulose fibers to release fermentable sugars for microbial conversion. The Gram-positive, thermophilic, cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum possesses a cellulolytic multienzyme complex termed the cellulosome, which has been widely considered to be nature’s finest cellulolytic machinery, fascinating scientists as an auspicious source of saccharolytic enzymes for biomass-based biofuel production. Owing to the supra-modular characteristics of the C. thermocellum cellulosome architecture, the cellulosomal components, including cohesin, dockerin, scaffoldin protein, and the plentiful cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes have been widely used for constructing artificial cellulosomes for basic studies and industrial applications. In addition, as the well-known microbial workhorses are naïve to biomass deconstruction, several research groups have sought to transform them from non-cellulolytic microbes into consolidated bioprocessing-enabling microbes. This review aims to update and discuss the current progress in these mentioned issues, point out their limitations, and suggest some future directions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This is the first study where the pyrolysis of the freshwater macroalga Chara vulgaris was explored to reveal its bioenergy potential. The suitability of C. vulgaris to bioenergy conversion via pyrolysis was accessed in terms of kinetic triplet and thermodynamic parameters. For this purpose, pyrolysis experiments under a thermogravimetric scale were conducted at multiple heating rates (5, 10, and 20 °C min−1) in an inert atmosphere. The mass-loss profiles of C. vulgaris pyrolysis showed that there are two dominant decomposition stages that are related to distinct chemical components inside its structure and that directly affect the calculated kinetic triplet and thermodynamics parameters. The average activation energy obtained using isoconversional methods of Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Starink, and Friedman was in the range of 52.87–72.91 kJ mol−1 for the first decomposition stage and 156.14–174.65 kJ mol−1 for the second decomposition stage. The pyrolytic conversion of C. vulgaris initially follows a second-order reaction model (first decomposition stage), while in second decomposition stage is controlled by a second-order Avrami-Erofeev reaction model. The kinetic results derived from the non-isothermal decomposition of C. vulgaris proved its suitable characteristics for pyrolysis. Additionally, multi-stage kinetic interpretation was successfully attained based on two kinetic triplets, where reconstructed pyrolysis behavior correlated well with experimental pyrolysis behavior. The changes in enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and entropy for first decomposition stage were 67.58±0.25 kJ mol−1, 180.77±5.30 kJ mol−1, and −176.65±0.41 J mol−1 K−1, and for the second decomposition stage the values were 166.70±0.09 kJ mol−1, 285.51±1.29 kJ mol−1, and −124.29±0.09 J mol−1 K−1, respectively. Based on thermodynamic aspects, C. vulgaris is particularly interesting for use as a raw material to produce biofuels and bioenergy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - For the specifications of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), eHealth systems, and wearable devices, batteries are not desirable. They maximize the sensor nodes’ size and need to be replaced every few years through human interference. Energy harvesting is now being studied as the primary source of electricity for wearable devices. Several initiatives have succeeded in using energy harvesting to operate the wearable devices’ electronic components. However, to rely primarily on energy harvesting in wearable devices, some obstacles need to be addressed. This work surveys the development of various energy harvesting methodologies utilized to drive wearable devices. The addressed harvesters are piezoelectric, glucose biofuel cell, triboelectric generators, thermoelectric generators, solar cells, and radio frequency (RF) harvesters. The advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of the addressed harvesters are mentioned. The application of the harvesters in invivo experiments is also discussed. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Orange wastes, including peel and pulp, were used as a biorefinery feedstock to produce pectin, ethanol, and biogas. The orange wastes were subjected to dilute acid treatment with sulfuric acid (1% w/v) at 94, 100, 140, and 180 °C for 60, 30, and 0 min. The sulfuric acid treatment was performed for pectin extraction, sugars hydrolysis, and lignocellulose pretreatment. The pectin was extracted from the hydrolysate, the liquor was used to produce ethanol, and the pretreated solid was anaerobically digested to produce biogas. The highest pectin extraction yield was 24.7 % (w/w) from orange peel and 23.7 % (w/w) from pulp, which was obtained from the supernatants of treatment at 94 °C for 60 min. Fourier transfer infrared spectrometer results confirmed the similar characteristics of the extracted pectin to a commercial product. The galacturonic acid content (an indicator of pectin purity) of pectin extracted from orange peel was 70.2 % and from orange pulp was 69.9 %, at the optimum conditions. The pectin obtained from the acid treatment at 94 °C for 60 min had a degree of esterification higher than 69 %, whereas it was less than 45 % for that obtained after treatment at 140 °C for 30 min. The maximum ethanol yields of 81.5 % (from peel) and 82.9 % (from pulp) were achieved from the hydrolysate of the acid treatment at 140 °C for 30 min. The highest methane yields were 176.8 mL/g volatile solids (from the untreated peel) and 191.8 mL/g volatile solids (from the untreated pulp). Overall, the maximum total product value was 2,472.9 USD/t orange wastes, which was achieved from dilute acid treatment at 94 °C for 60 min. At the optimal conditions for high production of pectin, without any enzyme consumption, 244 kg of pectin, 26.5 L of ethanol, and 36 m3 of methane were produced from 1 t of orange wastes. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Low-cost Ionic Liquid (IL) is a promising method for the lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment to produce bioethanol. This study investigates utilizing low-cost IL, [TEA][HSO4], for wheat straw pretreatment. The pretreatment was investigated in conditions characterized by a temperature of 130 °C, a high solid-to-solvent load ratio of 1:5 g/g, and 20 wt % water to separate lignin and carbohydrates from the source, which would subsequently undergo enzymatic hydrolysis. The highest delignification rate of 80% and the hemicellulose removal rate of 64.45% were observed in the case of a 3-h pretreated sample with [TEA][HSO4]. Two biomass samples pretreated for 0.5 h and 3-h showed high glucose saccharification yield levels of 50.36 and 87.19%, respectively, and 78.23% xylose yield was achieved in 3-h pretreated sample in enzymatic hydrolysis with commercial enzyme CelluMax in 72 h. Ethanol production and yield of 3-h pretreated biomass reached 43.1 g/L and 84.34% of the maximum theoretical yield after 48 h of fermentation time. However, the yield of the untreated biomass was only 10.76%. Obtained results clearly demonstrated that pretreatment with low-cost IL prior to enzymatic hydrolysis led to higher ethanol yield due to successful delignification. The process developed in this study exhibited economic feasibility of this technique in industrial bioprocess. © 2021

AB  - During the last few decades, energy demand is increasing rapidly. Concerning this, the use of renewables — lignocellulose biomass, for bioethanol production, as an efficient alternative to replacing fossil fuels, is highly recommended. In this study, valorization of two agricultural wastes was used for various hydrolytic enzyme production by Hymenobacter sp. CKS3, lignocellulosic hydrolysis, and bioethanol production. Conditions for obtaining maximum enzyme production, using agro-industrial waste — molasses and corn stover, were statistically optimized. Under the optimal conditions, in a medium containing 5.0% corn stover, 2.5% molasses, and during 94.55 h (∼4 days) of fermentation, the maximum enzymatic activity was achieved - CMCase 1.11 IU/ml, Avicelase 0.92 IU/ml, and pectinase 3.69 IU/ml. The obtained crude enzyme mixture was further used for enzymatic hydrolysis of non-treated corn stover and bioethanol production. The reducing sugar yield of 3.85 g/l was obtained under optimal conditions (corn stover 6.6% and time of hydrolysis 78.8 h (∼3 days and 7 h)). Scanning electron microscopy revealed structural changes in corn stover samples after enzymatic hydrolysis. Under non-optimized conditions, 0.37% of ethanol was produced by waste brewer's yeast. The obtained results show that bacteria belonging to the genus Hymenobacter have a still unexplored enzymatic potential that could be used for sustainable production of biotechnologically value-added products including biofuels. Specifically, for the first time, a soil bacterium, classified within the genus Hymenobacter, was used for cellulases (CMCase and Avicelase) and pectinase production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: A non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (GBFCs) with high-power density and adequate open-circuit potential in physiological environment is based on the improved hydrogen template electrodeposition of the platinum-nickel (PtNi) nanoalloys (the third step adopted a potential-step electrochemical synthesis instead of the conventional method). The morphology tests demonstrate that the highly porous PtxNi1-x nanoalloys exhibit broader pore-size distribution and larger specific electrochemically active surface area than the Pt monometallic nanostructures. Combined with cyclic voltammograms, polarization parameters and cell tests, degradation behavior measurements prove that the nanoalloy products display the excellent long-term stability and high electrocatalytic activity. Controlling the preparation conditions of the highly porous PtxNi1-x nanoalloys could control the morphology and nanostructure of the as-synthesis nanoalloys in order to improve the catalytic performance of these nanoalloys, which grants it great potentialities for controllable synthesis of electrocatalysts in the application of GBFCs.

AB  - In the current study, a purified lipase from Enterobacter sp. MG10 has been immobilized in three approaches, including lipase nano-flower (LNF), LNF/graphene oxide (GLNF), and cross-linked GLNF (CGLNF). The encapsulation yield (EY) and activity recovery (AR) were obtained in the range of 40.5 % to 81.0 % and 71.5 % to 132.2 % for lipase MG10, respectively. The best activity recovery was found (132.2 % for 0.02 mg ml−1 enzyme) in the presence of 200 mM of Cu2+ for 72 h incubation at 4 °C. The CGLNF showed broader pH and temperature activities compared to free lipase. Moreover, the CGLNF displayed a 60 % improvement in lipase activity after 28 days of incubation, compared to free lipase. Remarkably, the Km value of CGLNF was 0.980 mM toward the p-NPP substrate, whereas the Km value of free lipase was 17.11 mM at the same condition. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of CGLNF was 430.45 S−1 mM−1, compared with 21.32 S−1 mM−1 for the free lipase. The CGLNF showed 93 % efficiency in converting prosopis stephanina oil to biodiesel, whereas it found 63 % for the free lipase. Overall, these results showed the high potential of CGLNF nanobiocatalyst in synthetic biotechnology, especially in biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, lime (calcium hydroxide) treatment (LT) was applied as an alkaline pretreatment subsequent to hydrothermal treatment (HT) in terms of fermentable sugar and bioethanol production from acacia wood. To maximize the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, the condition of 200 °C for 10 min of HT was selected for subsequent lime treatment. The optimum conditions of LT were established to be a ratio of calcium hydroxide to hydrothermally treated acacia biomass of 12.2%, temperature of 70.9 °C, and reaction time of 23.5 h using a response surface methodology, and the maximum glucose yield by prediction and experiment were determined to be 74.4% and 73.5%, respectively. Further mechanical refining accelerated the access of the enzyme to glucan, resulting in an increase in glucose conversion (80.5%). Although the glucose yield by LT was 21.5% higher than that of HT, the ethanol yield was 33.5% lower due to the negative effect of residual calcium ions on yeast fermentation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The impact of wastewater cultivation was studied on pollutant removal, biomass production, and biosynthesis of high-value metabolites by newly isolated cyanobacteria namely Acaryochloris marina BERC03, Oscillatoria sp. BERC04, and Pleurocapsa sp. BERC06. During cultivation in urabn wastewater, its pH used to adjust from pH 8.0 to 11, offering contamination-free cultivation, and flotation-based easy harvesting. Besides, wastewater cultivation improved biomass production by 1.3-fold when compared to control along with 3.54–4.2 gL-1 of CO2 fixation, concomitantly removing suspended organic matter, total nitrogen, and phosphorus by 100%, 53%, and 88%, respectively. Biomass accumulated 26–36% carbohydrates, 15–28% proteins, 38–43% lipids, and 6.3–9.5% phycobilins, where phycobilin yield was improved by 1.6-fold when compared to control. Lipids extracted from the pigment-free biomass were trans-esterified to biodiesel where pigment extraction showed no negative impact on quality of the biodiesel. These strains demonstrated the potential to become feedstock of an integrated biorefinery using urban wastewater as low-cost growth media. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are potential sustainable renewable sources of energy but are highly underutilized due to the expensive and time-consuming downstream processing. This study aims at curbing these obstacles by extracting multiple components with a single processing unit. In this work, an ultrasound-assisted liquid triphasic flotation system was incorporated to extract proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates by phase separation. The parameters involved were optimized and the final recovery efficiency of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates was determined. A control run involving conventional three-phase partitioning and a 15-fold scale-up system with the recycling of phase components were also performed. Gas Chromatograph and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy were used to examine the potential of extracted products as a source of biofuel. This biorefinery approach is crucial in commercializing microalgae for biodiesel and bioethanol generation with a side product of purified proteins as feed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil health changes induced by prairie reconstruction (cultivated fields to tallgrass prairie) were assessed in Central Missouri within sites representing a chronosequence of 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13-yr post-reconstruction. In addition, a nearby remnant native prairie, two long-term reconstructed prairies (~25 and ~57-yr post-reconstruction), and a biofuel prairie 9-yr post-reconstruction were evaluated for comparative purposes. From 0 to 8-yr, prairie reconstruction increased soil aggregation, total soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), active C and N (permanganate oxidizable C and total protein), and mineralizable C and N (soil respiration and potentially mineralizable nitrogen), becoming more similar to levels in the remnant prairie. Further, four enzymes involved in the cycling of C (β-glucosidase), N (β-glucosaminidase), P (acid phosphatase), and S (arylsulfatase) demonstrated amplified activities within samples collected to a depth of 15-cm. Over time, the ratios of active C to SOC and active N to TN declined, reflecting the conversion of active C/N pools into more stable C/N pools due to continued organic inputs and increased microbial activity. In contrast, from 8- to 13-yr post-reconstruction, the number of these same soil health indicators declined, which may be attributed to historical land use, the improvement of prairie reconstruction and management strategies, and ecological processes related to succession. Overall, prairie reconstruction holds great potential for soil health restoration in degraded agricultural landscapes, and further study is needed to understand how historical land use and prairie reconstruction practices affect soil health and ecological resilience. © 2021

AB  - The hydroxyl groups adjacent to the β-1,4 glycosidic linkages in cellulose offer a crystalline structure, which makes depolymerization a difficult task. In the present study, a green synthesized nanomaterial, functionalized few-layer graphene (FFG) possessing exclusive cellulase enzyme mimicking properties, was exploited for the depolymerization of corn cob (CC)-derived cellulose moieties. Here, we studied the combined effect of cellulase and a very low concentration of FFG (0.02 wt% of biomass) on CC-derived cellulose hydrolysis, demonstrating 38% increase in hydrolysis compared to the control (i.e.without FFG). Most importantly, hydrolysis experiments were performed under mild conditions,i.e.at 50 °C, generating fermentable sugars without the formation of any inhibitor compounds. Furthermore, hydrolyzed CC cellulose was employed for bioethanol fermentation bySaccharomyces cerevisiaewhich produced 1.53 times higher ethanol in the presence of FFG. The residual solid part was further utilized for the formation of cellulose based nano-composite films. Here, we tried to develop a zero waste process by utilizing each component which can be an attractive sustainable option. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the cellulase mimicking activity of FFG nanosheets and their application in the hydrolysis of CC cellulose for improved bioethanol production, which can negate the need for costly cellulase enzymes required for biomass hydrolysis. Hence, the FFG-associated biomass to bioethanol process may pave the way toward the development of green sustainable biofuel technology for its foremost use as transport fuel. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Methanogenic bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) can convert carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) and may be used for anaerobic digester biogas upgrading. However, the effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a common biogas component, on BES performance is unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the effect of H2S addition to the cathode headspace on BES performance at a range of initial gas-phase H2S concentrations (0–6% v/v), as well as its effect on the anode and cathode microbial communities. As the initial cathode headspace H2S increased from 0 to 2% (v/v), biocathodic CH4 production increased by two-fold to 3.56 ± 0.36 mmol/L-d, due to dissolved H2S transport from the cathode to the anode where H2S was oxidized. Elemental sulfur and sulfate were H2S oxidation products detected in the anode. Above 3% initial cathode headspace H2S, biocathodic CH4 production declined due to inhibition. A phylotype most closely related to Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus dominated the cathode archaeal communities. In the sulfide-amended BES, a phylotype similar to the exoelectrogen Ochrobactrum anthropi was enriched in both the anode and cathode, whereas phylotypes related to sulfate-reducing and sulfur oxidizing Bacteria were detected in the bioanode. Thus, sulfide transport and oxidation in the anode play an important role in methanogenic BESs treating sulfide-bearing biogas. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The most productive C4 food and biofuel crops, such as Saccharum officinarum (sugarcane), Sorghum bicolor (sorghum) and Zea mays (maize), all use NADP-ME-type C4 photosynthesis. Despite high productivities, these crops fall well short of the theoretical maximum solar conversion efficiency of 6%. Understanding the basis of these inefficiencies is key for bioengineering and breeding strategies to increase the sustainable productivity of these major C4 crops. Photosynthesis is studied predominantly at steady state in saturating light. In field stands of these crops light is continually changing, and often with rapid fluctuations. Although light may change in a second, the adjustment of photosynthesis may take many minutes, leading to inefficiencies. We measured the rates of CO2 uptake and stomatal conductance of maize, sorghum and sugarcane under fluctuating light regimes. The gas exchange results were combined with a new dynamic photosynthesis model to infer the limiting factors under non-steady-state conditions. The dynamic photosynthesis model was developed from an existing C4 metabolic model for maize and extended to include: (i) post-translational regulation of key photosynthetic enzymes and their temperature responses; (ii) dynamic stomatal conductance; and (iii) leaf energy balance. Testing the model outputs against measured rates of leaf CO2 uptake and stomatal conductance in the three C4 crops indicated that Rubisco activase, the pyruvate phosphate dikinase regulatory protein and stomatal conductance are the major limitations to the efficiency of NADP-ME-type C4 photosynthesis during dark-to-high light transitions. We propose that the level of influence of these limiting factors make them targets for bioengineering the improved photosynthetic efficiency of these key crops. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The surface hydrophilicity of a gas-diffusion-type biocathode, in which bilirubin oxidase was immobilized, was regulated by varying the polymer binder hygroscopicity and UV-ozone treatment time of carbon composite electrodes. The surface hydrophilicity was found to influence its oxygen reduction activity by affecting the penetration of the electrolyte and O2 gas into the electrode layer. The oxygen reduction activity was maximized at an intermediate surface hydrophilicity because of the trade-off between enzyme utilization and oxygen diffusion. A glucose/O2 biofuel cell was fabricated by combining the optimal biocathode with a suitable bioanode fabricated with carboxylic acid-functionalized carbon nanotubes. We demonstrated that the glucose/O2 gas-diffusion-type biofuel cell exhibited a maximum current density of 3.0 mA cm-2 and a maximum power density of 0.66 mW cm-2. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract: Bamboo, with a high cellulose content comparable to that of wood, is a potential feedstock for biofuel and nanocellulose production. Mechanically isolated bamboo fibers and parenchyma cells exhibited remarkable differences in enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency as reported in a recent comparative study. It was assumed that cellulose microfibrils in bamboo fibers and parenchyma cells differ in their supramolecular structures. In the present study, X-ray diffraction and solid-state CP/MAS13C NMR studies indicated that, the two types of cells showed similar cellulose crystallinity index. The cellulose from bamboo fibers and parenchyma cells also exhibited differences in microfibril sizes, with lateral sizes of ca. 26.0–41.3 Å and ca. 22.7–39.3 Å for bamboo fibers and parenchyma cells respectively. It was further found that cellulose chains in bamboo fibers were more closely packed, supported by its smaller d-spacing than that of parenchyma cell cellulose. In addition, FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy revealed that there was a higher Iβ content in fibers than parenchyma cells. These differences in the crystalline structure of cellulose should be related to the lower recalcitrance to chemical degradation of parenchyma cells compared to bamboo fibers.

AB  - Brassica carinata is a non-food, low-carbon, none-to-low indirect land-use change impact oilseed feedstock grown for sustainable biofuels, bioproducts, and high protein seed meal. Understanding carinata growth and development is critical to the development of best management practices for maximum productivity and profitability of double-cropped farming systems. Field experiments were conducted during 2017–2018 (Year 1) and 2018–2019 (Year 2) winter–spring growing seasons in Quincy, Florida, to quantify the total aboveground dry matter accumulation (TDM), allocation, growth, nutrient uptake, and seed quality. The two carinata cultivars Avanza 641 and AX17012 accumulated 10826 and 9343 kg TDM ha−1 in Year 1 and 9655 and 10,642 kg TDM ha−1 in Year 2, respectively, at harvest maturity. The proportion of DM in the vegetative parts such as leaves and stems decreased, and the DM in reproductive structures such as silique walls and seeds increased with maturity. Seed yield (SY) was similar between cultivars but differed between years with Year 1 (2732 kg ha−1), producing 29% greater SY than Year 2 (1929 kg ha−1). Carinata primary stem has 17–20 leaf nodes, with 75%–88% of the axillary meristems producing primary and secondary branches. Crop growth rate (CGR) increased from vegetative to pod development for both cultivars in Year 1, while in Year 2, AX17012 and Avanza 641 attained maximum CGR at the pod development and bolting/flowering stages, respectively. Maximum seasonal nutrient uptake in leaves, stems, and siliques generally occurred in the early, mid, and late season, respectively, in both years. Seed weight, oil, monounsaturated fatty acids, C18:3, C20:1, and C22:1 concentrations increased with plant age, whereas protein, glucosinolate, polyunsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, C18:1, and C18:2 concentrations decreased with plant maturity. These results can be used for crop modeling to predict growth, development, and yield and aid in developing in-season decision support tools. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin; consequently, blood glucose levels increase to become abnormally high. Accordingly, the primary treatment of diabetes is to control glycemic levels continuously. To continuously control glycemic levels, several medical devices have been developed to monitor blood glucose levels, represented by sensors and monitors for the self-monitoring of blood glucose. The ultimate goal for those engaged in research to develop medical devices is to develop implantable biodevices, namely self-powered autonomously operated artificial pancreas systems. One of the most challenging issues in realizing an implantable artificial pancreas is the long-Term continuous supply of electricity, which is currently dependent on rechargeable batteries, requiring periodical replacement. In this work, we report the development of a direct electron transfer type enzyme-based miniaturized self-powered glucose sensor based on the BioCapacitor principle with a micro-sized enzyme anode area (0.15 mm × 0.75 mm), which has only 0.1 mm2 of electrode surface. As a result, a BioCapacitor utilizing a biofuel cell with a micro-sized enzyme anode was operated by self-power. In addition, the glucose concentration was detected within the range from 13 mM to 100 mM based on the frequency of charge/discharge cycles of the BioCapacitor. Although further improvement of the current density of the micro-sized anode is necessary to monitor a glucose concentration range lower than 13 mM, this self-powered glucose sensor with a micro-sized electrode based on the BioCapacitor principle was operated continuously for 6.6 h at 37 C in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Our success indicates the potential to realize self-powered, autonomous, and implantable sensing modules for bio devices such as glucose-sensing systems for an artificial pancreas. © 2021 JPhys Energy.

AB  - Production of valuable compounds including biofuels and pharmaceutical precursors derived from microalgae has garnered significant interest. Stable production of algal biomass is essential to make the microalgal industry commercially feasible. However, one of the largest issues is severe biological contamination by predators grazing the algal biomass, resulting in the crash of outdoor cultures. In the present study, we propose a novel engineering strategy for microalgae to cope with predators. The overexpression of plant chlorophyllase (CLH) in a microalga resulted in the enhancement of resistance to the predator. This result supported our hypothesis that CLH promotes chlorophyll breakdown in the chloroplasts of the microalgae when they are digested by the predator, generating the phototoxic catabolite chlorophyllide that damages the predator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish predator-resistant microalgae by enhancing the CLH activity. © 2021

AB  - The increased availability and production of lignocellulosic agroindustrial wastes has originated proposals for their use as raw material to obtain biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) or derived products. However, for biomass generated from lignocellulosic residues to be successfully degraded, in most cases it requires a physical (thermal), chemical, or enzymatic pretreatment before the application of microbial or enzymatic fermentation technologies (biocatalysis). In the context of enzymatic technologies, fungi have demonstrated to produce enzymes capable of degrading polysaccharides like cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin. Because of this ability for degrading lignocellulosic material, researchers are making efforts to isolate and identify fungal enzymes that could have a better activity for the degradation of plant cell walls and agroindustrial biomass. We performed an in silico analysis of alpha-glucoronidase in 82 accessions of the genus Aspergillus. The constructed dendrograms of amino acid sequences defined the formation of 6 groups (I, II, III, IV, V, and VI), which demonstrates the high diversity of the enzyme. Despite this ample divergence between enzyme groups, our 3D structure modeling showed both conservation and differences in amino acid residues participating in enzyme–substrate binding, which indicates the possibility that some enzymes are functionally specialized for the specific degradation of a substrate depending on the genetics of each species in the genus and the condition of the habitat where they evolved. The identification of alpha-glucuronidase isoenzymes would allow future use of genetic engineering and biocatalysis technologies aimed at specific production of the enzyme for its use in biotransformation. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The potential of the filamentous N2-fixing cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum for CO2 capture from high-loaded streams (i.e. flue gas or biogas) combined with the accumulation of glycogen (GL) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), was evaluated under nutrient-sufficient and nutrient-limited conditions. N. muscorum was able to grow under CO2 contents from 0.03 up to 30% v/v, thus tolerating CO2 concentrations similar to those found in raw biogas or flue-gas, with maximum CO2-fixation rates of 191.9 ± 46 g m−3 d−1 at a biomass concentration of 733.3 ± 207.4 mg TSS L−1. Despite N. muscorum was inhibited by the presence of H2S, the co-inoculation with activated sludge resulted in both CO2 and H2S depletion. Moreover, N. muscorum accumulated GL up to ∼54% dcw under N and P-deprivation, almost 36 times higher than that recorded under nutrients sufficient condition. The addition of 10% extra carbon in the form of valeric acid not only did not hamper the growth of N. muscorum (336.0 ± 113.1 mg TSS L−1) but also increased the GL content to ∼58% dcw. On the contrary, a negligible PHB accumulation was found under the tested conditions, likely due to the high CO2 concentration of 30% v/v in the headspace and therefore the high availability of inorganic carbon for the cultures. N. muscorum cultures achieved VFAs degradations up to ∼78% under controlled pH. These results supported N. muscorum as a sustainable alternative for CO2-capture and greenhouse gas mitigation or for photosynthetic biogas upgrading coupled with value added biomass production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Characterisation of pomace from citrus fruits, grapes and apples has shown to be rich in compounds that contain untapped energetic value with potential to serve as feedstock for biochemical and biofuel production. This study aimed to investigate the potential of recovering the energy in citrus (CtP), grape (GP) and apple (AP) pomace by extraruminal fermentations to produce VFA with utility to serve as precursors for hydrocarbon fuels. Chemical composition, neutral detergent fiber digestibility (seven incubation time points) and volatile fatty acid yield (after 96 h extraruminal fermentation) were analysed and compared among the three-pomace substrates. There were no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) in the apparent digestibility of CtP (77.3%) and AP (75.2%) while that of GP (55.2%) differed significantly from both (P &lt; 0.05). VFA yields corresponded to the digestibility in that GP (97.1 mM concentration, with a fractional yield 0.38 out of a possible 0.75) yielded the lowest amount of VFA compared to AP (126.4 mM concentration, with a fractional yield of 0.48 out of a possible 0.75) and CtP (136.4 mM concentration, with a fractional yield of 0.52 out of a possible 0.75). Analysis of the alkyl chain lengths of the VFA showed that both CtP (12.16 mmol alkyl g−1) and AP (11.31 mmol alkyl g−1) can serve as substrates for VFA electrochemical conversion to hydrocarbons. The results reported here have industrial implications as the produced VFA and the amount of alkyl chain lengths are the direct determinants of the mixture of hydrocarbons that can be produced.

AB  - This research assesses the well-to-tank (WTT) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic performance of an innovative bio-jet fuel via acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Dutch potato by-products from the food processing industry and sugar beets are explored as potential feedstocks. Four product systems differentiated by feedstocks, logistics and centralized/decentralized fermenters are investigated. For both feedstocks, it is found that a centralized large-scale fermentation is preferable to decentralized small-scale fermentation (25–30% less expensive and 5% lower WTT emissions). Once commercialization is reached, the cost and carbon performance of this novel bio-jet fuel could be similar to that of other alcohol-to-jet fuels. Depending on the feedstock and configuration considered, the GHG emission mitigation potential of this novel jet-fuel was estimated between 41% and 52%. To meet the EU RED II 65% GHG reduction criterion, possible options could be using low carbon-intensive processing energy and hydrogen or storing permanently biogenic carbon dioxide from fermentation. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - In most synthetic nanoreactor systems, catalysed products do not promptly diffuse away from the nanoreactor, which leads to lower than expected catalytic efficiencies. To address the diffusion problem, transient polymer micelle nanoreactor systems were achieved using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) as the fuel and activated esters as the energy dissipating units. These demonstrated pathway-dependent catalytic properties for transient micelles: product inhibition was observed or efficiently eliminated depending on EDC reloading in the metastable stage or after full dissipation for transient micelles. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Cellulose is the most abundant organic molecule on Earth and represents a renewable and practically everlasting feedstock for the production of biofuels and chemicals. Self-assembled owing to the high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interaction, cellulosomes are huge multi-enzyme complexes with unmatched efficiency in the degradation of recalcitrant lignocellulosic substrates. The recruitment of diverse dockerin-borne enzymes into a multicohesin protein scaffold dictates the three-dimensional layout of the complex, and interestingly two alternative binding modes have been proposed. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and molecular simulations on a range of cohesin-dockerin pairs, we directly detect varying distributions between these binding modes that follow a built-in cohesin-dockerin code. Surprisingly, we uncover a prolyl isomerase-modulated allosteric control mechanism, mediated by the isomerization state of a single proline residue, which regulates the distribution and kinetics of binding modes. Overall, our data provide a novel mechanistic understanding of the structural plasticity and dynamics of cellulosomes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are well-known artificial enzymes with peroxidase (PO)-like activity. PBAs have a high potential for applications in scientific investigations, industry, ecology and medicine. Being stable and both catalytically and electrochemically active, PBAs are promising in the construction of biosensors and biofuel cells. The “green” synthesis of PO-like PBAs using oxido-reductase flavocytochrome b2 is described in this study. When immobilized on graphite electrodes (GEs), the obtained green-synthesized PBAs or hexacyanoferrates (gHCFs) of transition and noble metals produced amperometric signals in response to H2 O2. HCFs of copper, iron, palladium and other metals were synthesized and characterized by structure, size, catalytic properties and electro-mediator activities. The gCuHCF, as the most effective PO mimetic with a flower-like micro/nano superstructure, was used as an H2 O2-sensitive platform for the development of a glucose oxidase (GO)-based biosensor. The GO/gCuHCF/GE biosensor exhibited high sensitivity (710 A M−1 m−2), a broad linear range and good selectivity when tested on real samples of fruit juices. We propose that the gCuHCF and other gHCFs synthesized via enzymes may be used as artificial POs in amperometric oxidase-based (bio)sensors. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease that must be carefully managed to prevent serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is a crucial tool for managing diabetes and, at present, all relevant procedures are invasive while they only provide periodic measurements. The pain and measurement intermittency associated with invasive techniques resulted in the exploration of painless, continuous, and non-invasive techniques of glucose measurement that would facilitate intensive management. The focus of this review paper is the existing solutions for continuous non-invasive glucose monitoring via contact lenses (CLs) and to carry out a detailed, qualitative, and comparative analysis to inform prospective researchers on viable pathways. Direct glucose monitoring via CLs is contingent on the detection of biomarkers present in the lacrimal fluid. In this review, emphasis is given on two types of sensors: a graphene-AgNW hybrid sensor and an amperometric sensor. Both sensors can detect the presence of glucose in the lacrimal fluid by using the enzyme, glucose oxidase. Additionally, this review covers fabrication procedures for CL biosensors. Ever since Google published the first glucose monitoring embedded system on a CL, CL biosensors have been considered state-of-the-art in the medical device research and development industry. The CL not only has to have a sensory system, it must also have an embedded integrated circuit (IC) for readout and wireless communication. Moreover, to retain mobility and ease of use of the CLs used for continuous glucose monitoring, the power supply to the solid-state IC on such CLs must be wireless. Currently, there are four methods of powering CLs: utilizing solar energy, via a biofuel cell, or by inductive or radiofrequency (RF) power. Although, there are many limitations associated with each method, the limitations common to all, are safety restrictions and CL size limitations. Bearing this in mind, RF power has received most of the attention in reported literature, whereas solar power has received the least attention in the literature. CLs seem a very promising target for cutting edge biotechnological applications of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic relevance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel production relies on complex multi-enzyme ensembles. Continuous and accurate measurement of the released key products is crucial in optimizing the industrial degradation process and also investigating the activity and interaction between the involved enzymes and the insoluble substrate. Amperometric biosensors have been applied to perform continuous cellobiose measurements during the enzymatic hydrolysis of pure cellulose powders. The oxygen-sensitive mediators used in these biosensors restricted their function under physiological or industrial conditions. Also, the combined measurements of the hydrolysis products cellobiose and glucose require a high selectivity of the biorecognition elements. We employed an [Os(2,2′-bipyridine)2Cl]Cl-modified polymer and cellobiose dehydrogenase to fabricate a cellobiose biosensor, which can accurately and specifically detect cellobiose even in the presence of oxygen and the other main product glucose. Additionally, a glucose biosensor was fabricated to simultaneously measure glucose produced from cellobiose by β-glucosidases. The cellobiose and glucose biosensors work at applied potentials of +0.25 and +0.45 V versus Ag|AgCl (3 M KCl), respectively, and can selectively detect their substrate. Both biosensors were used in combination to monitor the hydrolysis of pure cellulose of low crystallinity or industrial corncob samples. The obtained results correlate with the high-performance liquid chromatography pulsed amperometric detection analysis and demonstrate that neither oxygen nor the presence of redox-active compounds from the lignin fraction of the corncob interferes with the measurements. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - There is growing interest in expanding the production of soybean oils (mainly triacylglycerol, or TAG) to meet rising feed demand and address global energy concerns. We report that a plastid-localized glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), encoded by GmGPDHp1 gene, catalyzes the formation of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), an obligate substrate required for TAG biosynthesis. Overexpression of GmGPDHp1 increases soybean seed oil content with high levels of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), especially oleic acid (C18:1), without detectably affecting growth or seed protein content or seed weight. Based on the lipidomic analyses, we found that the increase in G3P content led to an elevated diacylglycerol (DAG) pool, in which the Kennedy pathway-derived DAG was mostly increased, followed by PC-derived DAG, thereby promoting the synthesis of TAG containing relatively high proportion of C18:1. The increased G3P levels induced several transcriptional alterations of genes involved in the glycerolipid pathways. In particular, genes encoding the enzymes responsible for de novo glycerolipid synthesis were largely upregulated in the transgenic lines, in-line with the identified biochemical phenotype. These results reveal a key role for GmGPDHp1-mediated G3P metabolism in enhancing TAG synthesis and demonstrate a strategy to modify the FA compositions of soybean oils for improved nutrition and biofuel. © 2021 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) is one of the branches of fuel cells that can provide high potential for various applications. However, EBFC has challenges in improving the performance power output. Exploring electrode materials is one way to increase enzyme utilization and lead to a high conversion rate so that efficient enzyme loading on the electrode surface can function correctly. This paper briefly presents recent technologies developed to improve bio-catalytic properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability, implantability, and mechanical flexibility in EBFCs. Among the combinations of materials that can be studied and are interesting because of their properties, there are various nanoparticles, carbon-based materials, and conductive polymers; all three have the advantages of chemical stability and enhanced electron transfer. The methods to immobilize enzymes, and support and substrate issues are also covered in this paper. In addition, the EBFC system is also explored and developed as suitable for applications such as self-pumping and microfluidic EBFC. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) consist of a class of enzymes that boost the release of oxidised products from plant biomass, in an approach that is more eco-friendly than the traditional ones, employing harsh chemicals. Since LPMOs are redox enzymes, they could possibly be exploited by immobilisation on electrode surfaces. Such an approach requires knowledge of kinetic and thermodynamic information for the interaction of the enzyme with the electrode surface. In this work, a novel methodology is applied for the determination of such parameters for an LPMO from the filamentous fungus Thermothelomyces thermophila, MtLPMO9H. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - We describe a modification of the lactate biofuel cell to increase its capacity. A new multi-step enzyme reaction system without NAD was prepared using a bioanode modified with lactate oxidase, pyruvate decarboxylase, and pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase. Its operating time was 6 times longer than that of the biofuel cell using the lactate oxidase-modified bioanode at constant current measurement of 1mAcm 2 because of suppression of the diffusion overpotential due to the decrease in the fuel concentration. © 2021 Chemical Society of Japan.

AB  - A greener processing route to replace the current environmentally-unfriendly esterification technique to produce biofuels such as pentyl valerate (PeVa) was explored. This study statistically optimized the covalent immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) onto biomass-based nanocellulose-silica (NC-SiO2) reinforced polyethersulfone (PES) membrane to synthesize PeVa. Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy of NC-SiO2-PES/CRL proved that CRL was successfully conjugated to the membrane. The optimized Taguchi Design-assisted immobilization of CRL onto NC-SiO2-PES membrane (5% glutaraldehyde, 4 h of immobilization, 20 mg/mL CRL concentration, 40 °C and pH 5) gave 90% yield of PeVa in 3 h. The thermal stability of NC-SiO2-PES/CRL was ~ 30% greater over the free CRL, with reusability for up to 14 successive esterification cycles. In a nutshell, the greener NC-SiO2-PES membrane effectively hyperactivated and stabilized the CRL for the esterification production of PeVa. This research provides a promising approach for expanding the use of sustainably sourced NC and SiO2 nanoparticles, as fillers in a PES for improving CRL activity and durability for an extended catalytic process.

AB  - The high-solid anaerobic digestion (AD) for anaerobic co-digestion of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) has low degradation efficiency. The enhancement of biogas production and EFB degradation efficiency by Bacteroides and Clostridium-rich methanogenic consortium was investigated. A Bacteroides and Clostridium-rich methanogenic consortium have xylanase, FPase, endo-glucanase, and exo-glucanase activity of 9.2, 1.3, 2.1, and 1.5 IU·mL−1, respectively with EFB degradation efficiency of 57.5%. Methane production (79 m3-CH4·tonne−1-EFB) by Bacteroides and Clostridium-rich methanogenic consortium augmentation was increased by 67.2%. The real application of bioaugmentation in the feedstock mixing tank before a feed to the AD reactor significantly increased methane yield (376.7 mL-CH4·g-1-VS−) by 85.5%. Bioaugmentation of Bacteroides and Clostridium-rich methanogenic consortium increased the number of hydrolytic bacteria and strengthened symbiotic relationships with indigenous microorganisms resulting in high biogas production, accelerated hydrolysis, and reduced solids accumulation of the high-solid AD process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion usually contains 30%-50% CO2, much of which must be removed, before utilization. Bioelectrochemical biogas upgrading approaches show promise, however, they have not yet been optimized for practical applications. In this study, a bioelectrochemical system with low energy input (applied cathode potential of -0.5 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) was used for in-situ biogas upgrading. High efficiency CO2 conversion (318.5 mol/d/m2) was achieved when the system was operated with an organic load of 1.7 kgCOD/(m3 d). Methane content in the upgraded biogas was 97.0% and CO2 concentrations stayed below 3%, which is comparable to biogas upgraded with more expensive and less sustainable physiochemical approaches. The high efficiency of this approach could likely be attributed to a significant enrichment of Methanothrix (92.7%) species on the cathode surface that were expressing genes involved in both acetogenic methanogenesis and direct electron transfer (DET). Electromethanogenesis by these organisms also increased proton consumption and created a higher pH that increased the solubility of CO2 in the bioreactor. In addition, CO2 removal from the biogas was likely further enhanced by an enrichment of Actinobacillus species known to be capable of CO2 fixation. Artificial neural network (ANN) models were also used to estimate CH4 production under different loading conditions. The ANN architecture with 10 neurons at hidden layers fit best with a mean square error of 6.06 × 10−3 and R2 of 0.99. © 2021

AB  - Electro-fermentation system (EFS) emerges its effectiveness on treating microalgae for biodiesel production, but much is unknown about biodegradation behaviors, biodiesel characteristics, and microbial community. Compared with conventional fermentation system (CFS), microbial electrolysis cell-based EFS (MEC-EFS) and microbial fuel cell-based EFS (MFC-EFS) were investigated for the performance while treating microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. Results indicated that MEC-EFS presented much higher first-order decomposition rate coefficients of carbohydrates and proteins (1.212/d and 0.951/d) than those of CFS (0.615/d and 0.794/d) and MFC-EFS (0.518/d and 0.415/d). Compared with MFC-EFS, MEC-EFS showed better electrochemical performance (2.17 A/m3 vs. 0.95 A/m3). Moreover, MEC-EFS reached the highest extracted lipid to biomass ratio (43.3%), followed by MFC-EFS (32.3%) and CFS (27.7%). By strengthened microbial biohydrogenation, MEC-EFS and MFC-EFS had higher saturated fatty acids ratio (78.8% and 70.6%) than that of CFS (56.1%). For MEC-EFS, enriched Ruminococcus and Geobacter in anodic biofilm might contribute to favorable biohydrogenation and electrochemical performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of bioaugmentation on microbial community and function in a continuous anaerobic process treating lignocellulosic cow manure. One reactor (Rb) received bioaugmentation dosage for a certain period (d100-d170) and stopped afterward (d170-d220), while the same applied to the control (Rc) except sterilized bioaugmentation dosage was introduced. Samples were taken on day130, 170 and 220 from both reactors for metatranscriptomic analysis. The results underlined the promotive effect of bioaugmentation on indigenous microorganisms regarding hydrolysis and methanogenesis. Bioaugmentation contributed to the enrichment of Clostridium, Cellvibrio, Cellulomonas, Bacillus, Fibrobacter, resulting in enhanced cellulase activity (Rb: 0.917–1.081; Rc: 0.551–0.677). Moreover, bioaugmentation brought Rb the prosperity of uncultured_ Bathyarchaeia, a prominent archaeal group responsible for the improved methyl-coenzyme M reductase activity, thus accelerated methanogenesis. Unique metabolic pathways (autotrophic carbon fixation and methanogenesis) in uncultured_ Bathyarchaeia broadened the horizon of its fundamental role as acetogens and methanogens in anaerobic digestion. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - To enhance microalgal lipid production, canonical two-step cultivation strategy that by transferring the microalgal cells grown in nutrient-replete medium to nutrient-depleted medium is widely used. However, the harvesting step during the transfer raises the production cost. To avoid the harvesting step, this study developed a continuous two-step (CTS) cultivation strategy. In the strategy, Chlorella sacchrarophila was grown in bioreactor while a xylanolytic bacterium Cellvibrio pealriver grown in an inner bag that embedded in the bioreactor; after the first-step co-cultivation, the inner bag is removed which then start the second-step cultivation of C. sacchrarophila. Based on the strategy, the lipid production was determined as 825.34–929.79 mg·L−1, which were 1.7–1.9 times higher than that of cultivation in canonical two-step strategy using glucose as feedstock. During the CTS strategy, the co-cultivation using xylan as feedstock promotes the microalgal growth and the removal of inner bag produces nutrient-depleted condition for enhancing microalgal lipid production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to over-consumption of fossil resources and environmental problems, lignocellulosic biomass as the most abundant and renewable materials is considered as the best candidate to produce biomaterials, biochemicals, and bioenergy, which is of strategic significance and meets the theme of Green Chemistry. Highly efficient and green fractionation of lignocellulose components significantly boosts the high-value utilization of lignocellulose and the biorefinery development. However, heterogeneity of lignocellulosic structure severely limited the lignocellulose fractionation. This paper offers the summary and perspective of the extensive investigation that aims to give insight into the lignocellulose prior-fractionation. Based on the role and structure of lignocellulose component in the plant cell wall, lignocellulose prior-fractionation can be divided into cellulose-first strategy, hemicelluloses-first strategy, and lignin-first strategy, which realizes the selective dissociation and transformation of a component in lignocellulose. Ultimately, the challenges and opportunities of lignocellulose prior-fractionation are proposed on account of the existing problems in the biorefining valorization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Low temperature performance determines that the application area of biodiesel is one of the most important parameters for biodiesel. Therefore, establishing a model between biodiesel composition and low temperature performance can help manufacturers easily select or deploy raw materials. In this study, different ML methods were evaluated for the first time to establish a prediction model between biodiesel composition and CFPP. The DT-based methods has good performance in predicting CFPP of biodiesel. The stacking method was shown to have the best prediction results and stability via verification of ET, stacking and MLP methods on the test set. Importance analysis shows that palmitic acid has the greatest influence on DT-based methods. This work determind that the coefficient of determination of stacking method (R2&gt;0.90) is significantly improved compared to the existing CFPP prediction model (R2=0.87). It provides support for the next step in a wider range of verification and promotion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Removing pollutants and producing high value-added products are essential steps for sustainable disposal and utilization of biogas residues. Here, a coupled thermophilic composting and vermicomposting process was used to remove Cr from biogas residues, and the composting products were co-fermented with the plant growth-promoting fungus Trichoderma to produce high value-added biofertilizers. The results showed that thermophilic composting for 37 d markedly increased the total content of Cr but decreased the percentage of available Cr fractions. Synchrotron-radiation-based observations further provided direct evidence of the binding sites to support the results from traditional sequential extraction. At a density of 60 g earthworm/kg biogas residues, vermicomposting removed 23–31% of Cr from biogas residues. After vermicomposting, co-fermentation of biogas residues and Trichoderma was optimized, in which Trichoderma spores were 2–5 × 108 cfu/g substrates. Together, coupling thermophilic composting and vermicomposting processes is a promising technique to remove a portion of heavy metals from biogas residues. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Extruded waste wood was subjected to microbial pre-treatment using two bacterial strains, Petronet Alfa and Petronet Omega. In phase one, the effects of strain type and dose, and incubation temperature on hydrolysis were investigated through measuring the amount of dissolved glucose content after hydrolysis. In phase two, biomethane potential (BMP) assays were conducted for microbially pre-treated wood waste under the optimum conditions obtained in phase one. Results showed that the effect of strain dose, temperature, and aeration on released glucose were statistically significant at p-value of 0.05 level. At the optimum conditions of using Petronet Omega at a dose of 5.0 g/L and 37 °C, the microbial pre-treatment could increase the amount of dissolved glucose by as much as 205%. The findings of BMP assays showed improvement in biogas production as a result of the substrate pre-treatment by Petronet Alfa and Petronet Omega where a biomethane yield of 54.4 and 49.1 mL CH4/g VS were obtained, respectively, which correspond to 88.9 and 70.2% increase compared with the control. Among four kinetic models tested, the modified Gompertz model demonstrated the best performance and showed that the lag phase was significantly reduced due to microbial pre-treatment of substrate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Amylases and proteases are among the industrially most important enzymes for food processing, animal feed, brewing, starch processing, detergents, healthcare, leather processing, and biofuel production. In this study, we investigated the growth kinetics and statistically optimized the co-production of amylase and protease in a phylogenetically novel haloalkaliphilic actinomycete, Streptomyces lopnurensis KaM5 of seawater. The Plackett-Berman design using Minitab 14.0 software was employed to assess the impact of the nutritional factors, temperature, pH, and incubation time. Further, starch, yeast extract, NaCl concentrations, and incubation time were optimized by Box-Behnken design at their three levels. The Pareto charts, contour, surface plots, and individual factorial analysis expressed the variability and levels for the optimal enzyme production. ANOVA analysis admitted the statistical fitness and significance level among the variables. A two-fold increase in enzyme production was achieved by cost-effective co-production media. The study was further extended to growth kinetics associated with enzyme production. Specific growth rate (μ), maximal cell mass (Xmax), volumetric product formation (Pmax), rate of product formation (Qp), and generation time (g) were computed and analyzed. These parameters significantly improved when compared with the pre-optimized conditions, and the production economics of the enzyme was industrially viable. The initial studies on the characteristics of the enzymes suggested its ability to function under the combination of alkaline pH and high salt concentrations. The co-production of enzymes from extremophiles can be a potentially viable option for large-scale production and applications. © 2021, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.

AB  - This study investigated combined alkali and heat pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for fermentative bioethanol production. Prior to fermentation, alkali pretreatment of corn stalk (CS) was carried out in NaOH solution under varying concentration which was followed by incubation at 100 °C for 1 h. The slurry of alkali-pretreated CS was supplemented with media and incubated at 30 °C, 96 h and pH 5. The 2.0% alkali pretreatment was most effective. Further optimization studies with filtrate and 5% inoculum size produced 43.8 g/L bioethanol. Chemical analysis of CS shows 61.75 and 71.49% degradation of hemicellulose and lignin, respectively, under optimal conditions. Structural changes of CS biomass monitored via scanning electron microscope showed that pretreatment with NaOH induced porosity and surface area disruption when compared to the untreated samples. Pretreated CS showed higher crystallinity index as revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The results showed that alkali-pretreated CS can serve as a potential feed stock for bioethanol production to reduce dependency on fossil fuel. © 2020, Society for Sugar Research & Promotion.

AB  - Abstract: Corn stalk (CS) is one of the most abundant agricultural residues containing high polysaccharides for low-cost bioethanol production. In this study, dilute acid along with intensified thermal pretreatment of CS and other parameters were optimized for higher yield of bioethanol. CS samples were pretreated using H2SO4 concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5% at 100 °C for 1 h reaction time. Optimal conditions of 2% acid-pretreated CS, 5% (w/v) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae addition and 48 h fermentation produced highest yield of bioethanol: 32.53 (g/L) which was 1.24-fold increase. Hemicellulose degradation of 75.68% was recorded in the 2% acid-treated substrate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed induced porosity and surface area disruption of CS in the treated samples. Crystallinity of the treated samples increased as shown by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Low concentrated H2SO4 coupled with thermal pretreatment could be a viable method of lignocellulosic biomass utilization for efficient bioethanol production.

AB  - With the advent of RenovaBio, Brazil has cast a new light towards the life cycle of cellulosic ethanol. Once considered a resource intensive alternative pathway to achieve the same biofuel, second-generation approaches can now provide an economic advantage due to their potentially lower carbon footprint. The exploration of lignocellulosic harvest residues to this end can be beneficial, since productivity can be increased while not expanding cultivated areas. Eucalyptus forest residues are an example, result of logging and harvest procedures, being a low-cost and readily available biomass. Through an integrated biorefinery process simulation and a Life Cycle Assessment of the coproduction of ethanol and electricity, it was analyzed whether forestry burden is truly relevant when exploring this material, identifying technical and environmental bottlenecks. The biorefinery design implementation of anaerobic digestion and energy integration allowed a productivity boost of 20% for ethanol and 115% for electricity. With a 80 km collection radius, an annual production capacity of 30.3 ML could be achieved in the Campinas region. Enzymes were identified as the main environmental hotspot, but inconsistent published datasets and lack of transparency lead to inconclusive results regarding this input. While the burden associated with the lignocellulosic feedstock is relevant in most impact categories, the main bottleneck resides within the biorefinery itself, with inputs related to pretreatment and hydrolysis, boiler emissions and water consumption. Nevertheless, eucalyptus harvest residues cannot be considered a burden-free resource, since additional operations such as retrieval and transportation cannot be dismissed and often surpasses the impact potential of the aforementioned forestry activities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is an attractive oxidoreductase for bioelectrochemical applications. Its two-domain structure allows the flavoheme enzyme to establish direct electron transfer to biosensor and biofuel cell electrodes. Yet, the application of CDH in these devices is impeded by its limited stability under turnover conditions. In this work, we aimed to improve the turnover stability of CDH by semirational, high-throughput enzyme engineering. We screened 13 736 colonies in a 96-well plate setup for improved turnover stability and selected 11 improved variants. Measures were taken to increase the reproducibility and robustness of the screening setup, and the statistical evaluation demonstrates the validity of the procedure. The selected CDH variants were expressed in shaking flasks and characterized in detail by biochemical and electrochemical methods. Two mechanisms contributing to turnover stability were found: (i) replacement of methionine side chains prone to oxidative damage and (ii) the reduction of oxygen reactivity achieved by an improved balance of the individual reaction rates in the two CDH domains. The engineered CDH variants hold promise for the application in continuous biosensors or biofuel cells, while the deduced mechanistic insights serve as a basis for future enzyme engineering approaches addressing the turnover stability of oxidoreductases in general. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - A new approach for biogas slurry disposal was put forward in this study through converting biogas slurry to the organic fertilizer of Spathiphyllum. The biogas slurry was firstly concentrated by vacuum distillation to reduce its volume by 80% who is called 5CBS, and then CO2 saturated to reduce its pH to about 6.50 ± 0.20. With or without adding the exogenetic Ca, Mg and P nutrients, CO2-rich 5CBS (i.e., CR-5CBS) was adopted as the root or foliar fertilizer to cultivate Spathiphyllum. Additionally, the commercial Spathiphyllum fertilizer was also experimented as a control. Results showed that the cases adopting CR-5CBS as the root or foliar fertilizer can obtain the agronomic traits and ornamental values of Spathiphyllum better those irrigated by the commercial fertilizer. Exogenetic nutrients added into CR-5CBS can lead to a decreased dead leaf number of Spathiphyllum, an enhanced N assimilation performance, however only a slightly improved assimilation performance of Ca, Mg and P. In terms of the fertilizer economy, CR-5CBS without exogenetic nutrient addition may be a promising for replacing the commercial Spathiphyllum fertilizer in the future. Economic and environmental pollution potential (EPP) analyses indicated that treating biogas slurry as the organic flower fertilizer can achieve a high net profit with about $ 28.89/m3-biogas slurry and a negative EPP value (−3.9), showing its profitability and environmental friendliness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recycling of biogas residues resulting from the anaerobic digestion of organic waste on agricultural land is among the means to reduce chemical fertilizer use and combat climate change. This in sacco decomposition study investigates (1) the potential of the granulated biogas residue fraction to provide nutrients and enhance soil carbon sequestration when utilized as exogenous organic matter in grassland soils, and (2) the impact of different nitrogen fertilizers on the organic matter decomposition and nutrient release processes. The experiment was conducted in two permanent grasslands of the Greater Region over one management period using rooibos tea as a comparator material. The decomposition and chemical changes of the two materials after incubation in the soil were assessed by measuring the mass loss, total carbon and nitrogen status, and fibre composition in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Overall, after the incubation period, granulated biogas residue maintained up to 68% of its total mass, organic matter and total carbon; increased its content in recalcitrant organic matter by up to 45% and released 45% of its total nitrogen. Granulated biogas residue demonstrated resilience and a higher response uniformity when exposed to different nitrogen fertilizers, as opposed to the comparator material of rooibos tea. However, the magnitude of fertilizer-type effect varied, with ammonium nitrate and the combinatorial treatment of raw biogas residue mixed with urea leading to the highest organic matter loss from the bags. Our findings suggest that granulated biogas residue is a biofertilizer with the potential to supply nutrients to soil biota over time, and promote carbon sequestration in grassland soils, and thereby advance agricultural sustainability while contributing to climate change mitigation. © 2021

AB  - Light-dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photo-decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520 nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose-methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photo-decarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15 °C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12-fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photo-decarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Ankistrodesmus falcatus is a globally distributed freshwater chlorophyte that is a candidate for biofuel production, is used to study the effects of toxins on aquatic communities, and is used as food in zooplankton research. Each of these research fields is transitioning to genomic tools. We created a reference transcriptome for of A. falcatus using NextGen sequencing and de novo assembly methods including Trinity, Velvet-Oases, and EvidentialGene. The assembled transcriptome has a total of 17,997 contigs, an N50 value of 2,462, and a GC content of 64.8%. BUSCO analysis recovered 83.3% of total chlorophyte BUSCOs and 82.5% of the eukaryotic BUSCOs. A portion (7.9%) of these supposedly single-copy genes were found to have transcriptionally active, distinct duplicates. We annotated the assembly using the dammit annotation pipeline, resulting in putative functional annotation for 68.89% of the assembly. Using available rbcL sequences from 16 strains (10 species) of Ankistrodesmus, we constructed a neighbor-joining phylogeny to illustrate genetic distances of our A. falcatus strain to other members of the genus. This assembly will be valuable for researchers seeking to identify Ankistrodesmus sequences in metatranscriptomic and metagenomic field studies and in experiments where separating expression responses of zooplankton and their algal food sources through bioinformatics is important. © 2021 Schomaker, Dudycha.

AB  - Microalgal triacylglycerols (TAGs) are a good feedstock for liquid biofuel production. Improving the expression and/or function of transcription factors (TFs) involved in TAG accumulation may increase TAG content; however, information on microalgae is still lacking. In this study, 14 TFs in the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae were identified as candidate TFs regulating TAG accumulation using available transcriptome and phosphoproteome data under conditions driving TAG accumulation. To investigate the roles of these TFs, we constructed TF-overexpression strains and analyzed lipid droplet (LD) formation and TAG contents in the cells grown under standard conditions. Based on the results, we identified four TFs involved in LD and TAG accumulation. RNA-Seq analyses were performed to identify genes regulated by the four TFs using each overex-pression strain. Among the TAG biosynthesis-related genes, only the gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum-localized lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 1 (LPAT1) was notably increased among the overexpression strains. In the LPAT1 overexpression strain, TAG accumulation was significantly increased compared with the control strain under normal growth conditions. These results indicate that the four TFs positively regulate TAG accumulation by changing their target gene expression in C. merolae. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background. Cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera is a widely distributed, devastating pest of over 200 crop plants that mainly consist of some cellulosic materials. Despite its economic importance as a pest, little is known about the diversity and community structure of gut symbiotic bacteria potentially functioned in cellulose digestion in different gut-sections of H. armigera. In view of this lacuna, we attempted to evaluate and characterize cellulose-degrading bacteria (CDB) from foregut, midgut, and hindgut -regions of H. armigera by using a culture-dependent approach. Methodology. The symbiotic bacteria were isolated from different gut-systems of H. armigera by enrichment techniques using Carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt (CMC) as carbon source. The isolated bacteria were purified and subsequently screened for cellulose-degradation by plate-based method to display the zones of CMC clearance around the colonies. The identification and phylogeny of the gut-bacteria were reconstructed by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Different enzymes such as endoglucanase, exoglucanase, β-glucosidase, and xylanase were assayed to determine the cellulolytic repertoire of the isolated bacteria. Results. The enrichment of CDB and subsequent plate based screening methods resulted in isolation of 71 bacteria among which 54% of the bacteria were obtained from foregut. Among the isolated bacteria, 25 isolates showed discernible cellulose-degradation potential on CMC-agar plates. The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing affiliated these cellulolytic bacteria to two major phyla viz., Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The members of the genus Klebsiella accounted for 39.43% of the total isolated bacteria while 31% of the Bacillus strains were enriched from hindgut region. The principal component analysis (PCA) further suggested that the members of Bacillus and Klebsiella together dominated the foregut and hindgut regions as they accounted for 68% of the total CDB. The four potential isolates selected on the basis of plate-based activities were further evaluated for their lignocellulases production by using various agricultural wastes as substrates. The PCA of the enzyme activities demonstrated that potential isolates majorly secreted endoglucanase and xylanase enzymes. Among the agro-wastes, multivariate analysis validated wheat husk (WH) and sugarcane bagasse (SCB) as most favorable substrates for xylanase and endoglucanase productions respectively. The overall findings suggest that H. armigera harbors diverse bacterial communities in different gut-sections that could assist the host in digestion processes, which may potentially serve as a valuable reservoir of some unique symbionts applied for biomass conversion in biofuel industry.

AB  - This work describes batch-type hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) treatments of conifer wood chips at 180–425 °C, under either air or nitrogen atmosphere. Such experiments allow efficient extraction of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and other valuable chemical substances, such as glycolic acid and acetic acid, from the lignocellulosic biomass. These compounds and their decomposition products present in the samples after HTL are analyzed and quantified using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. In general, the relatively higher-pressure nitrogen atmospheric condition is more suitable for obtaining the desired products, relative to the air atmosphere. Based on the quantitative results, the optimal temperatures for producing acetic acid, glycolic acid, and HMF are 300 °C, 250 °C, and 180 °C, respectively. The interesting relationship between HMF yield and temperature is also discussed; as the temperature increases, the yield of HMF first decreases and then increases. This phenomenon is explained by the exothermic nature of the HMF decomposition reaction, which is inhibited by excessively high temperature (in the range from 380 to 425 °C). At moderately high temperatures (optimized conditions; 300 °C), the generation rate of HMF exceeds its decomposition rate, resulting in a high yield of HMF. Based on the results of the experiments conducted in this study, the decomposition mechanism describing HTL treatment of wood chips can be elucidated. This study therefore provides guidance for future work involving HMF extraction from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The dissolution of cellulose is a critical step for the efficient utilization of this renewable resource as a starting material for high value-added chemical and biofuel production. In this study, three aprotic solvents were chosen to couple with three ionic liquids (ILs) as binary solvent systems for cellulose dissolution. The percentage of dissolved cellulose of each IL/co-solvent was evaluated and the crystallinity index (CrI) of the undissolved cellulose residues after dissolution were investigated by XRD. Dimethyl sulfoxide exhibited the most effective synergistic interaction with the ILs among three co-solvents for cellulose dissolution. In general, the higher percentage of dissolved cellulose of the IL/co-solvent binary system, the lower CrI value of the undissolved cellulose residue after dissolution. In addition, the dissolution of cellulosic materials with different crystallinity and degree of polymerization indicated that the crystallinity of a cellulosic material played a more dominating role than degree of polymerization in its dissolution process. The hydrogen bond basicity (β value) of selected IL/co-solvent binary system was also calculated. The results showed that the β value of a binary IL/co-solvent system exhibited different trend than neat IL in terms of the cellulose dissolution ability, which should be attributed to the co-solvent effect.

AB  - This research investigated a synthetic amendment to improve composting and resource recycling of pig manure and biogas residue. We further examined whether adding a synthetic amendment impacts the microbial ecosystem in the composted materials. Three mixing ratios were used to investigate composting performance: no synthetic amendment (T0), 5% synthetic amendment (T1), and 10% synthetic amendment (T2) (T1 and T2 were measured as a wet weight ratio). There were no significant differences in the fundamental characteristics between composting products in T0 and T1. The moisture content of composting material in T0, T1, and T2 significantly decreased from a baseline of approximately 65% to 35.5%, 37.3%, and 55.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the germination index significantly increased to 111.6%, 155.6%, and 62.3%, respectively. When an optimal proportion of synthetic amendment was added, T1 showed high degree of humification, lignocellulase activities, and effective biodegradation. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria, while Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungi in all treatment groups. Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis, starch, and sucrose metabolism were among the primary pathways in predicted functions. The synthetic amendment can generate a mature composting product and can be reused or recycled to conserve resources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Key message: Genes related to the MAPK cascade, ethylene signaling pathway, Pi starvation response, and NAC TFs were differentially expressed between normal and abortive ovules. Receptor-mediated ethylene signal perception and transmission play an important role in regulating fruit and ovule development. Abstract: Xanthoceras sorbifolium, a small to medium-sized tree endemic to northern China, is an emerging dedicated oilseed crop designed for applications in advanced biofuel, engine oil, and functional food, as well as for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Despite the importance of Xanthoceras seed oil, low seed productivity has constricted commercial exploitation of the species. The abortion of developing seeds (ovules after fertilization) is a major factor limiting fruit and seed production in the plant. To increase fruit and seed yields, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the abortion of fertilized ovules is critical. This study revealed differences in nucellus degeneration, endosperm development, and starch grain content between normally and abnormally developing ovules after fertilization. We constructed 6 RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries from normally and abnormally developing ovules at the onset of their abortion process. Comparative transcriptome analysis between the normal and abnormal ovules identified 818 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among DEGs, many genes involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, ethylene signaling pathway, and NAC transcription factor genes showed up-regulated expression in abnormal ovules. The RNA-seq data were validated using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) methods, evaluation of an ethylene receptor gene (XsERS) function indicated that the gene was closely related to early development of fruits and seeds. Based on the data presented here, we propose a model for a MAPK-ethylene signaling-NAC2 gene regulatory cascade that plays an important role in the regulation of the ovule abortion process in X. sorbifolium. The present study is imperative for understanding the mechanisms of ovule abortion after fertilization and identifying the critical genes and gene networks involved in determining the fate of ovule development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Lipase-mediated transesterification is a greener method for renewable biodiesel production, which can maintain high-level purity of the end products compared to the chemical transesterification methods. Hence, in this study, lipase was produced indigenously using Solid State Fermentation (SSF) from Rhizopus oryzae NRRL 3562, which was further immobilized on activated celite for transesterification. The evaluation of various transesterification attributes and stepwise optimizations were carried out for two different feedstock lipids, viz., a unialgal culture of Chlorella minutissima MCC 27, and a phyco-myco co-culture of C. minutissima MCC 27 and Aspergillus awamori. The optimal conditions, viz., 1:3–1:4 oil:methanol (molar ratio), 15 U lipase, 35 °-40 °C reaction temperature, 1% initial water loading, 1:0.4–1:0.6 substrate:hexane (w/v), 200–250 rpm agitation speed, and 30 h reaction duration ensued 91.52–93.25% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) conversions in the selected microbial strains. The spent lipase showed potential for cyclic use and was found to have upheld almost 90% residual activity at the end of the 5th cycle. The two resultant biodiesels showed comparable fuel properties except a marginal alleviation in density, viscosity, and iodine value in case of C. minutissima MCC 27 and A. awamori co-culture biodiesel compared to C. minutissima biodiesel. © 2021

AB  - Current study was designed for developing the novel nano-biocatalyst (Lipase-PDA-TiO2 NPs) for enzymatic transesterification of Jatropha curcas seed oil (JCSO). The TiO2 NPs were prepared by the hydrothermal method and were afterward modified by the polydopamine (PDA) polymer. The synthesized nanomaterial was characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Lipase activity assay was used to check the stability of immobilized enzyme under varying conditions of pH and temperature. Transesterification of JCSO using Lipase-PDA-TiO2 NPs catalyst was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Optimum biodiesel yield (92%) was achieved by carrying out the transesterification process for 30 h at 37 °C temperature with 10% nano-biocatalyst concentration, 6:1 methanol:oil ratio and 0.5% water content. On the basis of model significance, R2 value, lack of fit test and predicted vs. actual values, quadratic model was selected as the best fitted model. The FTIR technique was utilized to monitor the transesterification process. The comparison of the physiochemical characteristics of the synthesized biodiesel with the international standard for bio-fuel affirms that the transesterification of JCSO in the presence of the nano-biocatalyst provides an effective alternative for the production of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals is clean and affordable energy. This is also the aim of the Biofuels Act of 2007 in the Philippines. However, this law is confronted with challenges such as the limitation of lignocellulosic feedstock, specifically available for bioethanol production. The present study sought to address the issue by exploring the potential of mango seed husk (MSH), a by-product of the mango industry, in bioethanol production. MSH is considered a waste material and its utilization also permit value-addition as this can serve as an alternative and affordable source of feedstock in energy production. Two pretreatment strategies are employed to exploit the cellulose and hemicellulose content of MSH, namely, dilute acid treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Results show that the %H2SO4 resulting in the highest glucose concentration and yield is 4% v/v at 95 °C hydrolysis temperature, 1:10 (w/v) solid-to-solvent ratio, and 60-min hydrolysis time. For enzymatic hydrolysis using a commercial enzyme preparation, the reaction time up to 72 h did not affect glucose concentration and yield at the following conditions: 50 °C hydrolysis temperature, 150 rpm, pH 5.0, 10% solids loading, and 4% enzyme loading. This could be attributed to the lignin and non-structural compounds present in MSHs. However, a combined process strategy of dilute acid pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis in the pretreatment of MSH contributes to an increased concentration and yield of sugars in the hydrolysates, which is advantageous for bioethanol production.

AB  - Distillation and dehydration account for around 20 to 40% of the total energy consumption for first-generation bioethanol production. Due to the more dilute alcohol concentrations encountered in the second-generation processes, the conventional separation methods are not economically feasible. The main obstacles are the high-energy input demand and low thermodynamic efficiency. In this work, six alternative advanced layouts for alcohol recovery are simulated and benchmarked based on energy consumptions and thermodynamic efficiencies. Among these is the internally heat integrated distillation column, which, despite the research efforts of the last 40 years, is not yet established in the industry. Feed composition has been varied in the range of 0.75-5.0 wt % ethanol. The analysis results show that intensified distillation schemes can improve second law efficiency of about 65 to 80% and reduce energy consumptions by 67% compared to conventional distillation. The most optimal separation technologies investigated requires about 9.8 to 10.4 MJ/kg-EtOH for 0.75 wt % ethanol feed and 1.9-2.0 MJ/kg-EtOH for 5.0 wt % ethanol feed. These are the externally heat-integrated column, the internally heat-integrated column, and a four-effect distillation sequence. The results obtained in this study can allow for more optimal biofuel production, giving rise to potential improved business for sustainable green technology in the future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Although challenging, the generation of energy through the harvesting of electrons from biological fluids via fuel cells is a promising technology for wearable electronics. However, a current challenge is that neither a single molecular catalyst or an enzyme can completely oxidize fuels in biological fluids. With this issue in mind, herein, we report a hybrid bi-catalytic system allowing complete lactate oxidation by combining an organic catalyst, 4-amino-TEMPO (Amino-TEMPO), with a recombinant enzyme, oxalate decarboxylase (OxDc). This hybrid system was chosen due to the high oxidative catalytic activity of the molecular catalyst and the promiscuity of the recombinant enzyme to alternative substrates. The hybrid architecture enhanced the performance of the bioanode, enabling higher efficiency and improved stability of the energy-harvesting fuel cell. The hybrid system showed high catalytic activity, achieving a high and stable current density of 23.0 ± 1.5 mA cm−2 for lactate oxidation after 48 h of bulk electrolysis. Intermediate and product analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) confirmed that the hybrid architecture acts in the multiples catabolic steps of lactate oxidation, enabling the complete oxidation of lactate to CO2 by collecting 12 electrons from the fuel molecule. © 2021

AB  - An Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket reactor combined with a two-stage membrane bioreactor were operated for 193 days in order to evaluate the biological removal of carbamazepine (CBZ) from low-strength municipal wastewater. The system worked in three different organic load stages (0.7 ± 0.1 kg COD·m-3·d-1, 0.4 ± 0.1 kg COD·m-3·d-1 and 0.1 ± 0.0 kg COD·m-3·d-1) to assess the impact of the influent OLR on operational parameters such as anaerobic and aerobic sludge retention time (SRT), acidity, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), biomass activity or biogas production. The highest carbamazepine removals were achieved during the anaerobic stage (UASB reactor), reaching averages of 48.9%, 48.0% and 38.2% operating at high, medium and low OLR, respectively. The aerobic treatment (MBR) served as post-treatment, improving the removals, and the global UASB-MBR system reached averages of 70.0%, 59.6% and 49.8% when the influent was at medium and low OLR, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of combined biological systems on the removal of recalcitrant pharmaceuticals. © 2021 The Authors Water

AB  - Pyrolysis of furfural residue (FR) was performed at 450–850 °C by employing a fluidized bed pyrolyzer (FBP). Addition of Kaolin and Ca-bentonite to FR considerably increased the condensate yields. The highest condensate yield (24.96 wt%) was obtained at 650 °C when Ca-bentonite was added. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrum of pyrolysis oil (PO) indicated that catalysts promoted generation of alkene, amine, sulfate, sulfonyl chloride and oxime during pyrolysis. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) demonstrated that catalysts significantly increased the content of furfural and phenol in PO and the maximum phenol content (15.36%) was achieved in PO650-3 for CaO. The quite low relative proportion (RP) of ammonia nitrogen in liquid indicated that the dominant form of nitrogen in liquid was not ammonia nitrogen. CaO had the ability to reduce H2S release, indicating significant sulfur retention capacity. The maximum RP (99.29%) of chlorine in bio-char (BC) was observed with the addition of CaO, showing its strong chlorine retention capacity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the co-production of xylosaccharides and butanol from Eucalyptus grandis wood using steam explosion pretreatment in a biorefinery platform was investigated. The effect of different temperature conditions on xylosaccharide production and selectivity as well as enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated E. grandis substrates was studied using a pre-pilot steam explosion reactor. Under selected conditions (200 °C, 1.5 MPa, 10 min), steam explosion pretreatment led to about 50% xylan recovery as xylooligosaccharides (XOS) and xylose and 80% glucan enzymatic hydrolysis even at high solid loading. A xylosaccharide-rich hydrolysate was effectively separated by ion-exchange and resin treatment, containing mostly xylose and xylobiose as XOS. The fermentation performance of four native butanol-producing strains (Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 1731, Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6422, Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423 and Clostridium saccaroperbutylacetonicum DSM 14923) were evaluated using semi-synthetic media and enzymatic hydrolysates for butanol production. Results showed that ABE strain Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6422 and IBE strain Clostridium beijerinckii DSM 6423 are robust native strains for butanol production from lignocellulosic materials. This work highlights a potential integrated biorefinery process for the efficient utilization of E. grandis wood to produce biofuels and biochemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-situ biogas upgrading by H2 injection is a promising method for bio-natural gas production, yet the effect of H2 addition on antibiotic resistance genes during the in-situ biogas upgrading process remains unknown. We analyzed mesophilic and thermophilic in-situ biogas upgrading digesters with intermittent or continuous mixing models using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic methods to evaluate the effects of H2 addition on antibiotic resistance profiles. We found that H2 addition had less impact in the mesophilic reactor. In the thermophilic reactor, the influenced antibiotic resistance ontology (AROs) was mostly bound to the integral membrane transporters of the ATP-binding cassette and major facilitator superfamily. The annotated gene numbers of four drug classes, including macrolide, glycopeptide, lincosamide, and fluoroquinolone, increased distinctly after H2 addition. Acetate concentration is a vital indicator for distinguishing the abundance of different antibiotic efflux pumps. Most of the AROs influenced by Ruminiclostridium replaced the original dominant species Clostridium, and the versatile genus Methanosarcina was the sole methanogen correlated with the altered AROs of efflux pumps conferring antibiotic resistance. The introduced H2 was synthesized to CH4 via the hydrogenotrophic pathway of Methanosarcina flavescens, and part of the consumed H2 was used for cell growth. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diatoms are photoautotrophic unicellular algae and are among the most abundant, adaptable, and diverse marine phytoplankton. They are extremely interesting not only for their ecological role but also as potential feedstocks for sustainable biofuels and high-value commodities such as omega fatty acids, because of their capacity to accumulate lipids. However, the cultivation of microalgae on an industrial scale requires higher cell densities and lipid accumulation than those found in nature to make the process economically viable. One of the known ways to induce lipid accumulation in Phaeodactylum tricornutum is nitrogen deprivation, which comes at the expense of growth inhibition and lower cell density. Thus, alternative ways need to be explored to enhance the lipid production as well as biomass density to make them sustainable at industrial scale. In this study, we have used experimental and metabolic modeling approaches to optimize the media composition, in terms of elemental composition, organic and inorganic carbon sources, and light intensity, that boost both biomass quality and quantity of P. tricornutum. Eventually, the optimized conditions were scaled-up to 2 L photobioreactors, where a better system control (temperature, pH, light, aeration/mixing) allowed a further improvement of the biomass capacity of P. tricornutum to 12 g/L. © Copyright © 2021 Villanova, Singh, Pagliardini, Fell, Le Monnier, Finazzi and Poolman.

AB  - Biodiesel is a type of widely recognized environmentally friendly and sustainable biofuel. The key point for the industrial manufacturing of biodiesel is its cost, especially the price of raw oil feedstocks. Oil feedstocks of low quality require highly effective catalysts with more active sites (e.g., acid, base, acid-base, and enzyme) for (trans)esterification. Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a kind of polyporous material that can control its pore size and topological structure to fit the requirements of the catalytic reactions or conversion routes. This review focuses on the application of MOF-based catalysts in the preparation of biodiesel. Two methods of linking the active sites with MOF are introduced including intermolecular forces and chemical bridging or bonding. Four kinds of MOF-based nanocatalysts (i.e., enzyme, base, acid, and bifunctional catalysts) are evaluated and compared with other heterogeneous catalysts. Besides, technologies such as ultrasound and microwave for MOF-based nanocatalyst applications to produce biodiesel through transesterification and esterification are described. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspective for MOF-based nanocatalyst that applies to biodiesel production are provided. The MOF-based functional catalytic materials show great potential in biodiesel production and other relevant biorefineries. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is the only enzyme that catalyzes the acyl-CoAdependent acylation of sn-1, 2-diacylglycerol (DAG) to form triacylglycerol (TAG). The two main types of DGAT enzymes in the woody perennial biofuel plant Jatropha curcas, JcDGAT1 and JcDGAT2, were previously characterized only in heterologous systems. In this study, we investigated the functions of JcDGAT1 and JcDGAT2 in J. curcas. JcDGAT1 and JcDGAT2 were found to be predominantly expressed during the late stages of J. curcas seed development, in which large amounts of oil accumulated. As expected, overexpression of JcDGAT1 or JcDGAT2 under the control of the CaMV35S promoter gave rise to an increase in seed kernel oil production, reaching a content of 53.7% and 55.7% of the seed kernel dry weight, respectively, which were respectively 25% and 29.6% higher than that of control plants. The increase in seed oil content was accompanied by decreases in the contents of protein and soluble sugars in the seeds. Simultaneously, there was a two- to four-fold higher leaf TAG content in transgenic plants than in control plants. Moreover, by analysis of the fatty acid (FA) profiles, we found that JcDGAT1 and JcDGAT2 had the same substrate specificity with preferences for C18:2 in seed TAGs, and C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 in leaf TAGs. Therefore, our study confirms the important role of JcDGAT1 and JcDGAT2 in regulating oil production in J. curcas. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an attractive strategy for cleaning soils polluted with a wide spectrum of organic and inorganic toxic compounds. Among these pollutants, heavy metals have attracted global attention due to their negative effects on human health and terrestrial ecosystems. As a result of this, numerous studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanisms involved in removal processes. These studies have employed many plant species that might be used for phytoremediation and the obtention of end bioproducts such as biofuels and biogas useful in combustion and heating. Phytotechnologies represent an attractive segment that is increasingly gaining attention worldwide due to their versatility, economic profitability, and environmental cobenefits such as erosion control and soil quality and functionality improvement. In this review, the process of valorizing biomass from phytoremediation is described; in addition, relevant experiments where polluted biomass is used as feedstock or bioenergy is produced via thermo- and biochemical conversion are analyzed. Besides, pretreatments of biomass to increase yields and treatments to control the transfer of metals to the environment are also mentioned. Finally, aspects related to the feasibility, benefits, risks, and gaps of converting toxic-metal-polluted biomass are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The economics of the inedible oilseed crop Brassica carinata as a source of renewable fuels can be enhanced by converting its cellulosic biomass to value-added chemicals, such as organic acids. We investigated the biochemical conversion of carinata biomass to propionic acid by first pretreating the carinata meal (CM), which is obtained after extraction of the oil from carinata seeds, with concentrated phosphoric acid to remove hemicellulose and gain access to the cellulose constituent of the meal. We then subjected the pretreated meal to enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase enzyme to depolymerize cellulose to glucose. The overall conversion of carinata cellulose to glucose was 85%, which is promising. Finally, the recovered glucose was successfully fermented primarily to propionic acid using the bacterium Propionibacterium freudenreichii with a yield of 0.57 g of produced propionic acid per gram of consumed cellulosic glucose. The biobased propionic acid and other co-produced organic acids can serve as renewable building blocks for manufacturing industrial chemicals and food preservatives replacing fossil-derived organic acids. Hence, CM constitutes a renewable source of fermentable carbohydrates potentially improving the economics and sustainability of the carinata value chain. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Increasing demands for fuel production have led to the identification of brown macroalgae as an alternative feedstock for biofuel production. However, the conversion of macroalgae to biofuel using yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, requires the production of enzymes capable of hydrolysing macroalgal carbohydrates. In this study, three synthetic laminarinase-encoding genes from Rasamsonia emersonii (Relam1), Trichoderma viride (Tvlam1) and Trichoderma reesei (Trlam1), as well as a native laminarinase-like gene from S. cerevisiae (Sclam1) were cloned and expressed in the laboratory S. cerevisiae Y294 strain. Supernatant containing the Relam1 enzyme displayed the highest extracellular activity at 45 °C (0.2 U/mL), while supernatant from the strain co-expressing the Relam1 and Tvlam1 genes showed the highest extracellular activity at 37 °C (0.09 U/mL). The Relam1 and Tvlam1 laminarinases displayed optimum enzymatic activity at temperatures of 45 °C and 37 °C, respectively, and Relam1 retained more than 89% activity after 96 h at 45 °C. Large-scale fermentation of Ecklonia maxima macroalgae with S. cerevisiae Y294[Re/Tvlam1] in a benchtop bioreactor achieved 43% of the theoretic ethanol yield and 66% carbon conversion from laminarin. The successful expression of laminarinase-encoding genes in S. cerevisiae is an important milestone in exploiting brown macroalgae for bioethanol production via consolidated bioprocessing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is a great interest in the utilization of various renewable energy resources in the agricultural sector due to the production and consumption of limited fossil fuel resources and the ever-increasing energy demand in developing countries such as Iran. Investigation of agricultural production in various provinces of Iran revealed significant potential for bioenergy production in this sector including ethanol, butanol, methane, hydrogen, and biodiesel. Statistical data for each province including population, cultivated land area, energy and fertilizer consumption, and agricultural production rate were used to calculate CO2 emissions and bioenergy replacement potential. The energy demand, potential, and related CO2 emissions were computed and discussed. The energy demand in the agricultural sector was 36.2 TWh, 13.2 ktons, 2257.7 ktons, and 2408 Mm3 of electricity, kerosene, diesel, and natural gas, respectively. On the other hand, the potential of bioethanol, biodiesel and biogas was respectively 2.932×106m3, 0.44×106tons and 2.647×109m3. These biofuels are processed to replace fossil fuels. In the case of bioethanol and biogas, 10% of the calculated potential and total potential of biodiesel was assumed to be accessible. Accordingly, the potential to recover the bioethanol, biogas, and biodiesel demand is 100%, 11%, and 19.5%, respectively. In this scenario, the total CO2 emissions from the conventional energy system was 46.7 million tons per year, which can be decreased by 77.2% by changing the fuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) encompass a diverse group of plant cell wall proteoglycans, which play an essential role in plant development, signaling, plant-microbe interactions, and many others. Although they are widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom and extensively studied, they remain largely unexplored in the lower plants, especially in seaweeds. Ulva species have high economic potential since various applications were previously described including bioremediation, biofuel production, and as a source of bioactive compounds. This article presents the first experimental confirmation of AGP-like glycoproteins in Ulva species and provides a simple extraction protocol of Ulva lactuca AGP-like glycoproteins, their partial characterization and unique comparison to scarcely described Solanum lycopersicum AGPs. The reactivity with primary anti-AGP antibodies as well as Yariv reagent showed a great variety between Ulva lactuca and Solanum lycopersicum AGP-like glycoproteins. While the amino acid analysis of the AGP-like glycoproteins purified by the β-d-glucosyl Yariv reagent showed a similarity between algal and land plant AGP-like glycoproteins, neutral saccharide analysis revealed unique glycosylation of the Ulva lactuca AGP-like glycoproteins. Surprisingly, arabinose and galactose were not the most prevalent monosaccharides and the most outstanding was the presence of 3-O-methyl-hexose, which has never been described in the AGPs. The exceptional structure of the Ulva lactuca AGP-like glycoproteins implies a specialized adaptation to the marine environment and might bring new insight into the evolution of the plant cell wall. © 2020 Phycological Society of America

AB  - Microalgae have received continued attention as a potential source for biofuel production. However, the lack of suitable strains that provide a lipid-rich biomass and tolerate harsh condition inhibits their industrial application. This report describes an effort to transform Synechocystis sp. with genes encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a key regulatory enzyme in the lipogenesis pathway, from the white mustard plant (Sinapis alba) and the bacterium Escherichia coli DH5α using chitosan nanoparticles. Although a recombinant plasmid encoding S. alba ACC failed to express, successful transformation was achieved with a recombinant plasmid encoding E. coli DH5α ACC. The successful transformant, Synechocystis sp. PAK13, exhibited increased ACC expression compared with its wild-type parent (11.8 vs. 7.2 ng), which significantly increased its lipid content (by 3.6-fold). Synechocystis sp. PAK13 also exhibited a significant (20%) reduction in photosynthetic pigments, a 1.52-fold higher glucose content and a 3.5-fold lower sucrose content than the wild-type. In conclusion, this report introduces a useful strategy to overexpress the ACC gene in microalgae, creating strains with improved lipid production that are suited to industrial applications. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Brassica carinata has the potential to become an economical biofuel winter crop in the Southeast U.S. An IPM program is needed to provide management recommendations for B. carinata in the region. This study serves as the first steps in the developing IPM tactics documenting pest occurrence, pest position within the canopy, and the impact of defoliation on B. carinata yield. The study was performed in Jay, FL, during the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 winter/spring crop seasons. Pest species in B. carinata were documented by plant inspection within 16 genotypes of B. carinata, and the presence of insect pests in three canopy zones (upper, medium, and lower canopy) was documented. The defoliation impact on B. carinata was evaluated by artificial defoliation. Five levels of defoliation (2017–2018 crop season: 0%, 5%, 25%, 50%, and 100%; 2018–2019 crop season: 0%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100%) were artificially applied during vegetative, flowering, and pod formation stages of the commercial cultivar “Avanza64.” During the 2018–2019 crop season, two experiments were performed, a one-time defoliation event and continuous defoliation. The plants were hand harvested and the average number of pods per plants, seeds per pod, thousand seed weight, and yield were estimated and correlated with defoliation levels. Results indicated the following species of pests associated with B. carinata: Microtheca ochroloma Stål (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Plutela xylostella larvae, Pieris rapae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), Diabrotica undecimpunctata Barber (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Lipaphis pseudobrassicae Davis (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Leptoglossus phyllopus L. (Hemiptera: Coreidae), and Chloridea virescens F. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The insect distribution within the plant canopy was not uniform. Different levels of artificial B. carinata defoliation did not affect seed weight, the number of seeds per pod, or the oil content of the seeds. The number of pods per plants and estimated yield were negatively impacted by defoliation during the vegetative and flowering stages. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Carinata (Brassica carinata A. Braun), a non-food oilseed crop and an alternative bio-jet fuel feedstock, has received attention for its potential as a low-input option for production in the semi-arid region of the Northern Great Plains of the United States. Research addressing the impacts of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) fertilizers on soils and greenhouse gas (GHG; CO2, N2O, and CH4) emissions from carinata production are limited. Thus, objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of different rates of N and S fertilizers applied to carinata on soil properties and GHG emissions. Field experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 to assess the response of carinata to four N (56, 84, 112, and 140 kg N ha−1) and three S (0, 22, and 45 kg S ha−1) rates. Soil samples were collected at crop harvest to measure soil properties; however, soil surface GHG fluxes were measured during 2017 and 2018 growing seasons using static chamber method. Data showed that application of N fertilizer increased soil EC, soil organic carbon (SOC), stable C, and labile N. However, sulfur fertilizer decreased SOC, labile N, and soil inorganic N contents. Results from GHG fluxes showed that higher rates of N fertilizer application increased the soil CO2 and N2O emissions, whereas the S fertilizer did not impact these fluxes. This study concludes that S and N fertilizers application to carinata crop affected soil properties, and higher rates of N fertilizer increased the GHG emissions. Therefore, N fertilizer application rate needs to be optimized to mitigate GHG emission for carinata production. © 2021 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In order to produce an alternative energy of biodiesel using field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) seed oil, a novel Fe3O4/graphene oxide-phenylalanine bisulfate ionic liquid core-shell magnetic catalyst was developed. Ferroferric oxide nanoparticles and graphene oxide (GO) were employed to prepare a magnetic carrier of Fe3O4@GO nanocomposite which applied to immobilize phenylalanine bisulfate ionic liquid (PBIL). The immobilized PBIL was characterized by the means of characterization. The heterogeneous Fe3O4@GO@PBIL catalyst was demonstrated to have a high catalytic efficiency that reached 92.38 % of biodiesel yield under the optimal conditions (methanol/oil molar ratio of 10:1, reaction temperature of 60 °C, reaction time of 4 h, catalyst dosage of 25 wt%, stirring speed of 1500 r/min). After transesterification processes, the catalyst could be easily removed from the reaction mixture with an external magnet and showed little deactivation after multiple recycles. The main properties of biodiesel product were reconcilable with the range of test standards of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. In summary, the prepared Fe3O4@GO@PBIL catalyst behaved a superiorly catalytic performance, which made the produced biodiesel possess the possibility of application to biofuel as an ideal substitution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae are promising alternative feedstocks that can be used to produce biofuels and replace conventional fossil fuels. In order to increase the lipid production of microalgae, strain development via genetic engineering is required. To date, metabolic engineering studies have mainly focused on lipid synthesis pathways. However, the complicated metabolic pathways that exist in many organelles along with limitations of genetic engineering tools have made it difficult to obtain desirable microalgal strains. As an alternative strategy, we tried to increase carbon flux into fatty acid synthesis by overexpressing the NADP-dependent malic enzyme, NsME1, in Nannochloropsis salina. We found that the biomass and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) contents were increased in NsME1 overexpressing transformants, such that the FAME yield of the top-producing NsME1 transformant was 53% higher than the wild type. To understand the effects of NsME1 on lipid production, we analyzed the total carbon concentration and NADPH/NADP ratio, which were found to be enhanced in the transformants. We also investigated mRNA expression levels of genes involved in C4-like carbon concentrating mechanism and fatty acid synthesis by quantitative real-time PCR, and confirmed their positive contribution to fatty acid production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that overexpression of NsME1 could simultaneously improve the carbon concentration and reducing power in cells, thereby increasing the lipid and FAME yields of Nannochloropsis salina. We suggest that NsME1 can serve as a promising genetic target for enhancing lipid-based bio-products in Nannochloropsis and potentially other industrial microalgae. © 2021

AB  - Utilization of glycerol, a biodiesel byproduct, has not been well explored. In the present study, glycerol and the other carbon sources were studied for cometabolism of dibenzothiophene (DBT), a model chemical commonly used in bioremediation studies, by Paraburkholderia sp. C3. This study showed a direct association between rhamnolipids (RLs) biosynthesis and DBT biodegradation induced by different carbon sources in a Paraburkholderia specie. Glycerol can induce the strain C3 produce at least four RLs. The RL precursor is mainly derived from the fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) and β-oxidation pathway. The genome contained two (fabF and fabG) and four (fadA, fadE, fadB and echA) genes involved in FAS II and β-oxidation, respectively. The genome also carried the rhlA and rhlB genes involved in rhamnosyltransferase for RL biosynthesis and two DBT dioxygenase genes (nahAc and catA). The findings suggest a viable approach of using the biodiesel byproduct glycerol to remediate contaminated environments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Barley is a major cereal crop with a wide ecological range, and its lignocellulosic residues have the potential to be used as a feedstock for various purposes, including biofuel production. Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable source of carbon energy. However, its heterogeneous properties and intrinsic recalcitrance caused by cell wall lignification have lowered the biorefinery efficiency. The reduced lignin content and/or altered lignin structure have been desirable traits for lignocellulosic feedstock. We report the reduction of lignin content in barley by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase 1 (HvCOMT1), the lignin biosynthetic gene responsible for lignin syringyl unit formation. The transgene-free, homozygous HvCOMT1 mutant was generated and analyzed for its cell wall composition, saccharification efficiency, and bioethanol production performance. The mutant had 14% lower total lignin content and 34% higher fermentable glucose recovery rate, compared to the wild-type (WT). The bioethanol concentration and yield from the hydrolysates of the mutant biomass were 14.3 g/L and 0.46 g/g total sugar, respectively. This result was 34% and 12% higher than those obtained from WT (10.7 g/L and 0.41 g/g total sugar). Under controlled environmental conditions, the overall growth performance of the HvCOMT1 mutant was similar to WT, with no distinct morphological variations between them. The HvCOMT1 mutant barley could offer improved quality lignocellulosic feedstock for efficient lignocellulosic biofuel production. © 2021 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae often couples high biomass production with lipid accumulation, and thus it is considered a useful approach to obtain high quantities of added value microalgal biomass. In this study, the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was supplied with glycerol to determine the potential of the mixotrophic alga for the accumulation of lipids. In preliminarily experiments, T. pseudonana was cultivated in the presence of increasing concentrations of glucose, acetate and glycerol in order to select the best organic carbon source for growth promotion, and glycerol was selected for further experiments. The best glycerol dose for both biomass productivity and lipid production was 2.5 g L−1. To overcome the costs of the pure glycerol supply, the crude glycerol derived from a biodiesel production plant was also tested, as a low-cost alternative. Beside growth and photosynthetic parameters useful to monitor the algal conditions, lipid amount and profile were compared between autotrophic and pure/crude glycerol-treated algae. Interestingly, an almost doubled lipid content was accumulated in mixotrophic algae compared to the autotrophic ones. Moreover, an evident increase in a relatively short-chain fatty acid (C14:0, myristic acid), potentially useful for bio-jet fuels, and in a long-chain omega3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (C18:4; stearidonic acid), interesting for nutritional purposes, was highlighted in mixotrophic samples, especially when cultivated with crude glycerol. Differently, the fatty acid profile obtained from the autotrophic cultures suggested a preferable employment of the algal biomass for biodiesel production, owing to the prevalence of palmitic and palmitoleic acids. This study highlights that the mixotrophic cultivation of T. pseudonana drives the algal metabolism towards the production of different lipids, suitable for diversified applications. Moreover, the use of biodiesel-derived crude glycerol could make mixotrophy economically advantageous, in particular considering a bio-refinery approach. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae constitute a heterogeneous and diverse range of organisms capable of accumulating bioactive metabolites, making them promising feedstock for applications in the nutraceutical, functional food, animal feed, biofertilisation or biofuel sectors. There has been renewed interest in recent times in natural sources of antioxidants, particularly as health products and preserving agents. Microalgae strains isolated from aquatic habitats in Ireland were successfully brought into culture. The 91 strains were grown phototrophically in nutrient-enriched media to generate biomass, which was harvested and assessed for antioxidant potential. Extracts were screened for antioxidant activity using a modified volumetric Trolox-ABTS assay and the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Two heterokont marine strains of interest were further studied to ascertain variations in antioxidant capacity across different stages of batch culture growth. The antioxidant activity of extracts of bacillariophyte cf. Stauroneis sp. LACW24 and ocrophyte cf. Phaeothamnion sp. LACW34 increased during growth with a maximum being observed during the late stationary or early death phase (2.5- to 8-fold increases between days 20 and 27). Strains LACW24 and LACW34 contained 5.9 and 3.0 mg g−1 (DW) of the xanthophyll fucoxanthin, respectively. Extracts of strains also showed no cytotoxicity towards mouse cell lines. These results highlight the potential of these strains for biomass valorisation and cultivation upscaling and to be further considered as part of ongoing bioprospecting efforts towards identifying novel species to join the relatively narrow range of commercially exploited marine microalgae species. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Disposal and/or treatment of olive mill wastewaters (OMW) or semisolid wastes (alperujo) are among the most important environmental problems in the Mediterranean region due to the presence of high organic content, e.g., phenols, low nitrogen concentration, and high concentrations of slowly biodegradable compounds such as lipids and fatty acids. In the present study, a new scheme for olive oil production process with almost zero wastes is proposed where all the olive fruit ingredients are used for the production of goods: extra virgin olive oil, olive pomace oil, various antioxidants, animal feed, solid fuels, and water for irrigation. The idea involves separation of the, rich in oil, pulp (60–65%) from the olive pit (stone). The pit contains a woody shell and the kernel (seed) which also contains oil and can be utilized for the extraction of olive-residue oil with hexane while the remaining solid is used as biofuels (pellet). First, the paste is driven to a pilot oil extraction system (2-phase decanter) to get the olive oil and then the phenols are extracted from the remaining pulp. The remaining paste (solid edible phase) can be sterilized using UV and can be enriched with spices and herbs to produce edible solid paste for food industry or for animal food. The extracted samples of phenolic and other miscible organic substances are treated with a membrane system for the enrichment of phenolics. The commercialization of phenols and other isolated byproducts can contribute to reducing the cost of the proposed process. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as important solvents for conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks to fuels and chemicals due to their ability to enable efficient biomass deconstruction and fractionation. Woody biomass derived from forest and agricultural residues has the potential to be used for production of biofuels and its removal from forests can help mitigate disastrous wildfires in fire-prone states like California. This study evaluated woody biomass types (pine, almond, walnut, and fir) from California as potential biofuel feedstocks. The feedstocks were pretreated with the ILs cholinium lysinate ([Ch][Lys]) and ethanolamine acetate ([EOA][OAc]), followed by enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of lignocellulosic sugars to produce ethanol. Under optimal conditions, [EOA][OAc] pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis generated glucose and xylose yields in the range of 24-82 and 14-80%, respectively, while glucose and xylose yields for the [Ch][Lys] ranged between 28-83 and 23-80%, respectively. Maximum fermentable sugar was released from almond wood, and the lowest amount was from pine and fir. Blends of feedstocks were also explored, and a blend with a mass ratio of 2/2/1 (almond/walnut/pine) resulted in maximum glucose and xylose (>90%) yields using [Ch][Lys]. Fermentation of this hydrolysate using a C5-utilizing strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in a maximum ethanol concentration of 17.9 g/L for mixture biomass hydrolysate, corresponding to 60.8% fermentation efficiency. This study represents the first demonstration of the use of these ILs for pretreatment of woody biomass blends that resulted in a high overall conversion efficiency for ethanol production. ©

AB  - With a diverse and widely distributed global resource base, woody biomass is a compelling organic feedstock for conversion to renewable liquid fuels. In California, woody biomass comprises the largest fraction of underutilized biomass available for biofuel production, but conversion to fuels is challenged both by recalcitrance to deconstruction and by toxicity toward downstream saccharification and fermentation due to organic acids and phenolic compounds generated during pretreatment. In this study, we optimize pretreatment and scale-up of an integrated one-pot process for deconstruction of California woody biomass using the ionic liquid (IL) cholinium lysinate [Ch][Lys] as a pretreatment solvent. By evaluating the impact of solid loading, solid removal, yeast acclimatization, fermentation temperature, fermentation pH, and nutrient supplementation on final ethanol yields and titers, we achieve nearly full conversion of both glucose and xylose to ethanol with commercial C5-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then demonstrate process scalability in 680 L pilot-scale fermentation, achieving >80% deconstruction efficiency, >90% fermentation efficiency, 27.7 g/L ethanol titer, and >80% ethanol distillation efficiency from the IL-containing hydrolysate post fermentation. This fully integrated process requires no intermediate separations and no intermediate detoxification of the hydrolysate. Using an integrated biorefinery model, current performance results in a minimum ethanol selling price of $8.8/gge. Reducing enzyme loading along with other minor process improvements can reduce the ethanol selling price to $3/gge. This study is the largest scale demonstration of IL pretreatment and biofuel conversion known to date, and the overall biomass-to-ethanol efficiencies are the highest reported to date for any IL-based biomass-to-biofuel conversion. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study lipolytic biocatalysts GD-95RM, GDEst-95 and GDEst-lip were immobilized by encapsulation in calcium alginate beads. All three immobilized biocatalysts demonstrated significantly increased thermal stability at 60–70 °C temperatures and the activity of GD-95RM lipase increased by 50% at 70–80 °C following the immobilization. Moreover, encapsulated GDEst-95 esterase retained higher than 50% lipolytic activity after 3 months of incubation with butanol (25%) and ethanol (50%); GDEst-lip enzyme possessed 50% activity after 2 months of treatment with ethanol (25%) and methanol (25%); and GD-95RM lipase displayed higher that 50% activity after two-week incubation with methanol (50%). All three immobilized enzymes displayed long-term storage capability (>50% activity) at least until 3 months at 4 °C. It was also detected that immobilized GD-95RM and GDEst-lip can perform flow hydrolysis of both avocado oil and p-NP dodecanoate in prototype packed-bed column reactor. The analysis of continuous transesterification of avocado or sunflower oil with ethanol or methanol as substrates confirmed that encapsulated GD-95RM and GDEst-lip enzymes is a useful approach to produce fatty acid alkyl esters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Furfural can be mass-produced from lignocellulose biomass and can be a platform chemical for producing valuable chemicals. In this study, we examine Ni/SiO2 catalysts for the conversion of furfural under a hydrogen atmosphere. The reactivity and the product selectivity are governed by the reaction temperature and the Ni particle size. A catalyst pretreatment by including calcination prior to hydrogen reduction leads to Ni/SiO2–CR with large Ni particles (∼ 15 nm) and a high selectivity to furfuryl alcohol (FA) at below 200 °C. The Ni/SiO2-R is hydrogen-pretreated without a prior calcination and it contains small Ni particles (∼ 5 nm) and exhibits relatively high selectivity to furan. The turnover frequency (TOF) of furfural conversion is 239 and 408 h−1, respectively, on Ni/SiO2-CR and Ni/SiO2-R at 175 °C, when the former shows 100% selectivity to FA and the latter exhibits a selectivity of around 38% and 62%, to FA and furan, respectively. Moreover, the furan can be reacted to produce propylene and CO by the Ni catalysts at above 200 °C and Ni/SiO2-R exhibits a higher activity than Ni/SiO2-CR. The results suggest that the furfural hydrotreating reaction over Ni catalysts is structure sensitive and a proper design of catalyst and operating temperature can provide a full furfural utilization, either to FA (a biofuel), or to furan and propylene (as chemical feedstock). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diatoms are microscopic biorefineries producing value-added molecules, including unique pigments, triglycerides (TAGs) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), with potential implications in aquaculture feeding and the food or biofuel industries. These molecules are utilized in vivo for energy harvesting from sunlight to drive photosynthesis and as photosynthetic storage products, respectively. In the present paper, we evaluate the effect of narrow-band spectral illumination on carotenoid, LC-PUFAs and TAG contents in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Shorter wavelengths in the blue spectral range resulted in higher production of total fatty acids, namely saturated TAGs. Longer wavelengths in the red spectral range increased the cell’s content in Hexadecatrienoic acid (HTA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Red wavelengths induced higher production of photoprotective carotenoids, namely fucoxanthin. In combination, the results demonstrate how diatom value-added molecule production can be modulated by spectral light control during the growth. How diatoms could use such mechanisms to regulate efficient light absorption and cell buoyancy in the open ocean is discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Isoprenol (3-methyl-3-butene-1-ol) is a valuable drop-in biofuel and an important precursor of several commodity chemicals. Synthetic microbial systems using the heterologous mevalonate pathway have recently been developed for the production of isoprenol in Escherichia coli, and a significant yield and titer improvement has been achieved through a decade of research. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been widely used in the biotechnology industry for isoprenoid production, but there has been no good example of isoprenol production reported in this host. In this study, we engineered the budding yeast S. cerevisiae for improved biosynthesis of isoprenol. The strain engineered with the mevalonate pathway achieved isoprenol production at the titer of 36.02 ± 0.92 mg/L in the flask. The IPP (isopentenyl diphosphate)-bypass pathway, which has shown more efficient isoprenol production by avoiding the accumulation of the toxic intermediate in E. coli, was also constructed in S. cerevisiae and improved the isoprenol titer by 2-fold. We further engineered the strains by deleting a promiscuous endogenous kinase that could divert the pathway flux away from the isoprenol production and improved the titer to 130.52 ± 8.01 mg/L. Finally, we identified a pathway bottleneck using metabolomics analysis and overexpressed a promiscuous alkaline phosphatase to relieve this bottleneck. The combined efforts resulted in the titer improvement to 383.1 ± 31.62 mg/L in the flask. This is the highest isoprenol titer up to date in S. cerevisiae and this work provides the key strategies to engineer yeast as an industrial platform for isoprenol production. © 2021 International Metabolic Engineering Society

AB  - Background: Lignocellulose is considered a renewable organic material, but the industrial production of biofuel from lignocellulose is challenging because of the lack of highly active hydrolytic enzymes. The guts of herbivores contain many symbiotic microorganisms that have evolved to hydrolyze plant lignocellulose. Chinese bamboo rats mainly consume high-fiber foods, indicating that some members of the intestinal tract microbiota digest lignocellulose, providing these rats with the energy required for growth. Results: Here, we used metagenomics to analyze the diversity and functions of the gut microbiota in Chinese bamboo rats. We identified abundant populations of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria, whose main functions involved carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleic acid metabolism. We also found 587 carbohydrate-active enzyme genes belonging to different families, including 7 carbohydrate esterase families and 21 glycoside hydrolase families. The glycoside hydrolase 3, glycoside hydrolase 1, glycoside hydrolase 43, carbohydrate esterase 4, carbohydrate esterase 1, and carbohydrate esterase 3 families demonstrated outstanding performance. Conclusions: The microbes and enzymes identified in our study expand the existing arsenal of proficient degraders and enzymes for lignocellulosic biofuel production. This study also describes a powerful approach for targeting gut microbes and enzymes in numerous industries. How to cite: Bai D, Lin X, Hu Y, et al.

AB  - Dairy wastewater is characterized by high concentration of organic compounds and is commonly used for energy production. Methods for enhancement of biogas production include application of magnetizers on the digester to induce static magnetic field (SMF). The study aimed at investigation of Bacteria and Archaea communities during anaerobic digestion of model dairy wastewater exposed to SMF. Magnetic field caused a significant increase in methane production to 373.2 mL/g VS compared to 200.2 mL/g VS in a control reactor and methane content to 56.8% compared to 49.1% in a control reactor. In both reactors, the biomass was dominated by Trichococcus sp. The relative abundance of lactic acid bacteria was of about 10% higher in the reactor exposed to SMF. This higher number of Lactobacillales resulted from a higher acetate production, which additionally caused enhanced growth of Methanosarcinacaea in the reactor exposed to SMF. SMF also stimulated the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. © 2020

AB  - BACKGROUND: Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose is regarded as the most efficient route to producing fermentable sugars, one kind of promising future biofuel, while physiochemical pretreatment is the initial but most critical step for the efficient utilization of lignocellulose. RESULTS: In this study, a recoverable carbonaceous solid acid catalyst Fe3O4@C-SO3H was used in combined organosolv pretreatment of Eucalyptus biomass at 140–180 °C with 50 vol% ethanol. The introduction of solid acid in ethanol pretreatment remarkably alleviated the requirement of smaller biomass size, but provided less influence on cellulosic degradation, which benefited the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose. After the pretreatment using 50 vol% ethanol and 20% catalyst at 160 °C, 60.3% hemicellulose and 52.6% lignin were removed from Eucalyptus (75–250 μm) within 60 min, which resulted in a cellulose retention ratio of &gt;90% and improved hydrolysis efficiency by nearly 20 and 2 folds, respectively, compared to untreated and ethanol pretreated materials. CONCLUSION: This study explored a novel pretreatment technique to improve the efficiency of enzymatic saccharification. It also demonstrated that the hydrolysis yield of cellulose had significantly positive correlation with the removal of lignin and hemicellulose in Eucalyptus, but was less affected by cellulose crystallinity. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Maize (Zea mays) caffeate 3-O-methyltransferase (ZmaysCOMT, EC 2.1.1.68), a key enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway, catalyzes the O-methylation of caffeic acid to ferulic acid, a precursor of lignin polymer and a crucial component of the cell wall structure. Plant cell wall recalcitrance is due to lignin, and the discovery of specific inhibitors of ZmaysCOMT could be useful to increase the digestibility of the lignocellulose biomass and improve the production of cellulosic biofuels. In this work, we have modeled the three-dimensional structure of ZmaysCOMT and prospected promising inhibitors by using virtual screening techniques. A set of 1668 putative candidates was screened from a virtual library and docked in the active site of the enzyme, and nitecapone was selected as one of the most promising enzyme inhibitors. Details of the mode of inhibition were assessed by in silico simulation and in vitro assays of nitecapone on the enzyme. In comparison with the nitecapone-free control, kinetics parameters showed different values of Vmax and KM, suggesting a kinetic profile such as mixed inhibition of the ZmaysCOMT. In brief, we suggest that the nitecapone-induced inhibition of ZmaysCOMT may serve as a non-transgenic strategy to explore the biosynthesis of ferulic acid and lignin, their relationships with the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass, and, possibly, to improve bioethanol production. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Low contents of water-soluble carbohydrates and/or low indigenous microbial activity in wilted maize stover (WMS) usually hinder the establishment of the ensiling process, thereby resulting in a low biogas production because of high loss of dry matter (DM). To enhance the biological activity and substrate biodegradability, this study applied the synergistic regulation of sucrose (carbon source) and increasing levels of urea (nitrogen source) during the ensiling process of WMS. Compared with the application of only sucrose, a higher organic acid content (lactic acid (85 g/kg-DM) and acetic acid (14 g/kg-DM)) and higher degradation ratios for lignocellulose (hemicellulose (28%), cellulose (22%), and lignin (17%)) were observed with urea applications of 1.7% (DM) and 3.9% (DM), respectively. This was caused by the enhanced activities of the hetero-fermenter (Weissella) and cellulolytic bacteria (Cellulosimicrobium). A simultaneous addition of urea and sucrose during the ensiling of WMS increased the specific methane yield by 11.2%–21.1% in comparison to raw WMS. Moreover, an economic cost estimation revealed that this approach could be an effective storage strategy for the efficient production of methane when employing a 1.7% (DM) urea application. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of edible oils with elevate purity in the biodiesel production represents around 70% of the chain of feedstocks applied in the process by the main producing countries at world level. This occurs due, mainly, to reaction limitations of the traditional alkaline route employed industrially. Bypassing drawbacks of the chemical process, enzymatic technique is an effective alternative for the biodiesel synthesis. In this sense, this paper reports results to semi-continuous production of biodiesel on pilot scale, from waste cooking oil, via hydroesterification mediated by different commercial lipases in liquid formulation: Eversa® Transform and its novel thermostable successor Eversa® Transform 2.0. Data for yields, residual acidity, productivities, biocatalysts performance, kinetics and economic analysis are presented in this comprehensive research. Using the best reaction conditions found (40 °C, 0.7 wt% of Eversa® Transform 2.0, 4.0 wt% of water, methanol to oil molar ratio of 6.3:1 and 8 h at a two-step reaction system), 96.2% of FAME yield was achieved. A pseudo-first order model presented a good fit of the experimental data, where a kApp of 0.373∙h−1 was obtained for the process with the best performance. Moreover, for this process, an economic analysis indicated the feasibility of the system through a positive net return and operating cost of US$ 0.50 kg−1 of biofuel. This information served as foundation to conclude that enzymatic hydroesterification catalyzed by liquid lipases has the necessary tools to be implemented on industrial biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Integration of anaerobic digestion with agricultural activities can further reduce energy and material consumption and achieve substantial environmental and economic benefits from stand-alone biogas options. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd
This paper provides an example of the kind of analysis needed to support better targeted policies to reduce the environmental impacts of agricultural activities, using the specific case of Anaerobic Digestion (AD) to treat animal manure and other agricultural and food wastes in British Columbia (BC). Economic and life cycle environmental performance metrics are estimated to compare integrated and stand-alone systems using the resulting biogas and digestate. Using biogas for heating outperforms purifying it for distribution as renewable natural gas (RNG). However, current policy and energy prices in BC perversely support RNG, making biogas-fired heating systems economically unattractive. The performance of biogas-fired heating system can be improved and their dependence on subsidies reduced by integration with local agricultural activities, exploiting CO2 and digestate as by-products. Biogenic CO2, from combustion of the biogas and from mushroom cultivation, can displace natural gas use in producing CO2-enriched atmospheres to enhance growth rates in greenhouse production. Using digestate as growing media in greenhouses and mushroom cultivation can generate significant revenues but the environmental benefits are nugatory. Co-digestion of food waste can further improve performance by increasing biogas yield. With all extra benefits combined, integrated AD systems can increase both GHG mitigation and revenues by at least 80%. The analysis illustrates the general point that, to avoid perverse outcomes, policy measures must support options based on their actual GHG mitigation benefits, rather than targetting any specific technology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A modifiable, spontaneously formed and biocompatible polymer gel, composed of phosphorylcholine and N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, is reported, which can be subjected to postmodification by amine-containing mediators to obtain a redox zwitterionic gel. Owing to attractive interactions between the polymer chains, the network structure of the polymer gel is formed spontaneously in ethanol or water. In addition, the designed hydrogel can serve as an enzyme-immobilizing matrix for enzymatic bioelectrodes. We illustrate the potential applications of the hydrogel with a biofuel cell that demonstrated superior operational stability over 10 days and the unaffected current of the bioelectrode in concentrated protein solution (45 mg mL-1). Compared with a typical redox hydrogel, the zwitterionic moieties with high hydration endow the redox zwitterionic hydrogel with (i) better environment for preserving enzyme's activity and (ii) resistance to biofouling caused by protein adsorption. These properties contribute to overcoming the most challenging issues in the field of implantable bioelectronic applications, as insufficient operational stability and lack of biocompatibility severely limit their feasibility for practical applications. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We developed a "signal-on"self-powered biosensing strategy by taking full advantage of both photoelectrochemical biofuel cells (PBFCs) and metal-organic framework (MOF)-controlled release behavior for ultrasensitive microRNA assay. PBFC-based self-powered sensors have the unique characteristics of non-requirement of external power sources, simple fabrication process, miniature size, good anti-interference ability and low cost. Furthermore, based on the target microRNA-induced release of the electron donor ascorbic acid and the high catalytic ability of the biocathode to catalyse the oxygen reduction reaction, photo-driven self-powered biosensors for ultrasensitive microRNA detection were successfully realized. The as-proposed signal-on biosensor not only provides a simple and effective strategy, but also possesses the merits of a wide dynamic concentration response range and high sensitivity for microRNA detection, with a limit of detection down to 0.16 fM.

AB  - Biofuels produced from photosynthetic microorganisms such as microalgae and cyanobacteria could potentially replace fossil fuels as they offer several advantages over fuels produced from lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, energy production potential in the form of bioethanol was examined using different biomasses derived from the growth of a cyanobacteria-based microbial consortium on a chemical medium and on agro-industrial wastewaters (i.e., dairy wastewater, winery wastewater and mixed winery–raisin effluent) supplemented with a raisin residue extract. The possibility of recovering fermentable sugars from a microbial biomass dominated by the filamentous cyanobacterium Leptolynbgya sp. was demonstrated. Of the different acid hydrolysis conditions tested, the best results were obtained with sulfuric acid 2.5 N for 120 min using dried biomass from dairy wastewater and mixed winery–raisin wastewaters. After optimizing sugar release from the microbial biomass by applying acid hydrolysis, alcoholic fermentation was performed using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Raisin residue extract was added to the treated biomass broth in all experiments to enhance ethanol production. Results showed that up to 85.9% of the theoretical ethanol yield was achieved, indicating the potential use of cyanobacteria-based biomass in combination with a raisin residue extract as feedstock for bioethanol production. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Despite extensive use in the biofuel industry, only butyryl co-A dehydrogenase enzymes from the Clostridia group have undergone extensive structural and genetic characterization. The present study, portrays the characterization of structural, functional and phylogenetic properties of butyryl co-A dehydrogenase identified within the genome of Pusillimonas ginsengisoli SBSA. In silico characterization, homology modelling and docking data indicates that this protein is a homo-tetramer and 388 amino acid residue long, rich in alanine and leucine residue; having molecular weight of 42347.69 dalton. Its isoelectric point value is 5.78; indicate its neutral nature while 38.38 instability index value indicate its stable nature. Its thermostable nature evidenced by its high aliphatic index (93.14); makes its suitable for industry-based use. The secondary structure prediction analysis of butyryl co-A dehydrogenase unveiled that the proteins has secondary arrangements of 54% α-helix, 13% β-stand and 5% disordered conformation. However, phylogenetic analysis clearly indicates that probably horizontal gene transfer is the primary mechanism of spreading of this gene in this organism. Notably, multiple sequence alignment study of phylogenetically diverse butyryl co-A dehydrogenase sequence highlighted the presence of conserved amino acid residues i.e. YXV/LGXKXWXS/T. Physicochemical characterization of other relevant proteins involved in butanol metabolism of SBSA also has been carried out. However, metabolic construction of functional butanol biosynthesis pathway in SBSA, enlightened its cost-effective potential use in biofuel industry as an alternate to Clostridia system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Iron (Fe) availability has well-known effects on plant and microbial metabolism, but its effects on interspecies interactions are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate metabolite exchange between the grass Brachypodium distachyon strain Bd21 and the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25::gfp/lux (SBW25) during Fe limitation under axenic conditions. We compared the transcriptional profiles and root exudate metabolites of B. distachyon plants grown semihydroponically with and without SBW25 inoculation and Fe amendment. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the hydroponic solution revealed an increase in the abundance of the phytosiderophores mugineic acid and deoxymugineic acid under Fe-limited conditions compared to Fe-replete conditions, indicating greater secretion by roots presumably to facilitate Fe uptake. In SBW25-inoculated roots, expression of genes encoding phytosiderophore biosynthesis and uptake proteins increased compared to that in sterile roots, but external phytosiderophore abundances decreased. P. fluorescens siderophores were not detected in treatments without Fe. Rather, expression of SBW25 genes encoding a porin, a transporter, and a monooxygenase was significantly upregulated in response to Fe deprivation. Collectively, these results suggest that SBW25 consumed root-exuded phytosiderophores in response to Fe deficiency, and we propose target genes that may be involved. SBW25 also altered the expression of root genes encoding defense-related enzymes and regulators, including thionin and cyanogenic glycoside production, chitinase, and peroxidase activity, and transcription factors. Our findings provide insights into the molecular bases for the stress response and metabolite exchange of interacting plants and bacteria under Fe-deficient conditions. © 2021 Boiteau et al.

AB  - Co-fermentation of 1,3-propanediol and 2,3-butanediol from crude glycerol derived from biodiesel production process was investigated. The isolation of diols producer was firstly investigated. Factors including crude glycerol, yeast extract concentrations, and initial pH affecting diols were optimized using isolated microbes as the inoculum. Results determined strain MU-01 as the most efficient strain producing the highest concentration of diols. Sequence analysis revealed strain MU-01 as a member of Enterobacter sp. (Accession no. MT491125). Crude glycerol, yeast extract, and pH were influenced on 1,3-propanediol and 2,3-butanediol. Maximum 1,3-propanediol of 0.70 g/L was obtained at 10 g/L crude glycerol, 1 g/L yeast extract, and pH 8, respectively. The strain MU-01 also produced 2,3-butanediol at the concentration of 0.88 g/L under optimal conditions. The validation experiment indicated that the model was accurate, with a 2.85% difference between expected and observed values. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The inhibitory effect of toxic byproducts mainly derived from the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass is one of the limiting factors hindering industrial application. In this work, a simple yet practicable aeration strategy was proposed to enhance microbial tolerance to inhibitors, including formic acid, acetic acid, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF). Batch fermentation by Kluyveromyces marxianus CICC 1727−5 using xylose and glucose alone and in combination under different aeration conditions coupled with multiple inhibitors was performed. The fermentation time and residual xylose significantly decreased with high xylitol production (0.7 g/g) and high ethanol production (0.42 g/g) at an aeration rate of 0.5 vvm. The postglucose effect was effectively relieved during co-fermentation by the microaeration strategy. Transcriptomics analysis was performed to determine the mechanism of inhibitor resistance. Transcription of genes related to DNA replication, protein processing, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of the ribosome, amino acids, peroxidase, sterols, and unsaturated fatty acids were significantly upregulated accompanied by downregulated expression of genes related to autophagy under aeration conditions in the presence of multiple inhibitors. These results provide a valuable reference for future studies on biofuel fermentation from lignocellulosic biomass by a facultative fermenting microbe. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Most soil carbon (C) is in the form of soil organic matter (SOM), the composition of which is controlled by the plant–microbe–soil continuum. The extent to which plant and microbial inputs contribute to persistent SOM has been linked to edaphic properties such as mineralogy and aggregation. However, it is unknown how variation in plant inputs, microbial community structure, and soil physical and chemical attributes interact to influence the chemical classes that comprise SOM pools. We used two long-term biofuel feedstock field experiments to test the influence of cropping systems (corn and switchgrass) and soil characteristics (sandy and silty loams) on microbial selection and SOM chemistry. Cropping system had a strong influence on water-extractable organic C chemistry with perennial switchgrass generally having a higher chemical richness than the annual corn cropping system. Nonetheless, cropping system was a less influential driver of soil microbial community structure and overall C chemistry than soil type. Soil type was especially influential on fungal community structure and the chemical composition of the chloroform-extractable C. Although plant inputs strongly influence the substrates available for decomposition and SOM formation, total C and nitrogen (N) did not differ between cropping systems within either site. We conclude this is likely due to enhanced microbial activity under the perennial cropping system. Silty soils also had a higher activity of phosphate and C liberating enzymes. After 8 years, silty loams still contained twice the total C and N as sandy loams, with no significant response to biofuel cropping system inputs. Together, these results demonstrate that initial site selection is critical to plant–microbe interactions and substantially impacts the potential for long-term C accrual in soils under biofuel feedstock production. © 2020 Battelle Memorial Institute.

AB  - Alkaline environments are abundant globally and cause damage to most organisms, while some microalgae can grow well and accumulate lipids under those conditions. Here the mechanisms of alkali resistance and lipid accumulation in the alkaliphilic microalgae Chlorella sp. BLD were explored using physiological-biochemical and transcriptome analysis. When cultivated at alkaline pH, Chlorella sp. BLD exhibited good alkali-resistance ability and increased biomass (0.97 g L−1). The biochemical composition of Chlorella sp. BLD changed significantly (lipid content increased 39% and protein content decreased 19.5%) compared with pH 7.5. Through transcriptome analysis, we found that pathways related to carbon metabolism such as photosynthesis, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle were significantly regulated under alkaline conditions. Genes that encoding the key enzyme in carbon-related metabolism such as Rubisco, AMY, PK, ME, CS, ACAT, KAS, and DGAT were identified. Transcriptional regulation of these genes results in carbon flow switching from starch and protein to cell wall metabolism, organic acid synthetic and lipid accumulation in response to alkaline conditions. These results reveal the alkali resistance mechanism of Chlorella sp. BLD and provide a theoretical basis for microalgae oil production under alkaline conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigates the oxidative stability and corrosivity of residual cooking oil (RCO) methyl biodiesel exposed to metallic coupons (copper and carbon steel) under simulated storage conditions (static immersion for 90 days within closed vessels) and the effect of antioxidants (tert-butylhydroquinone, curcumin, propylgallate, and butyl-hydroxyanisole) on biodiesel and metallic surfaces. The induction period measured during the experiment showed that all antioxidants retarded biodiesel degradation due to their antioxidant properties. Scanning-electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction of the metallic surfaces revealed the presence of oxides due to the corrosion by biodiesel in absence of antioxidants. Nevertheless, the presence of carbonaceous solids over the metallic surfaces was found which evidences the anticorrosive properties of the antioxidants, confirmed by X-Ray spectroscopy that showed increase in the content of carbon and oxygen on the surfaces. Measurements of corrosion rate also confirmed the anticorrosive action of all antioxidants. Hence, this work shows the dual properties of antioxidants acting as free radical scavengers in the RCO biodiesel as well as corrosive inhibitors, with a special performance of propylgallate, probably due to the presence of more hydroxyl groups in its structure that also may facilitate its interaction with the metallic surface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymes from hyperthermophilic archaea are potential candidates for industrial use because of their superior pH, thermal, and long-term stability, and are expected to improve the long-term stability of biofuel cells (BFCs). However, the reported multicopper oxidase (MCO) from hyperthermophilic archaea has lower redox potential than MCOs from other organisms, which leads to a decrease in the cell voltage of BFCs. In this study, we attempted to positively shift the redox potential of the MCO from hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (McoP). Mutations (M470L and M470F) were introduced into the axial ligand of the T1 copper atom of McoP, and the enzymatic chemistry and redox potentials were compared with that of the parent (M470). The redox potentials of M470L and M470F shifted positively by about 0.07 V compared with that of M470. In addition, the catalytic activity of the mutants towards 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) increased 1.2–1.3-fold. The thermal stability of the mutants and the electrocatalytic performance for O2 reduction of M470F was slightly reduced compared with that of M470. This research provides useful enzymes for application as biocathode catalysts for high-voltage BFCs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The poorly controlled discharge of coffee husks in Ethiopia causes severe environmental pollution and is a waste of resources. The volatile solid and carbon content in coffee husks waste indicates that it is rich in organic matter and has huge potential to produce biogas. This study investigated the feasibility of coffee husks to produce biomass through anaerobic digestion, based on temperature, initial pH, inoculum/substrate (I/S) ratio and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. The study demonstrated that the maximum production of biogas and methane reached 3359.6 ml and 2127.30 ml, respectively, under the conditions of mesophilic temperature (35±1°C), an initial pH of 7, an I/S ratio of 0.75 and a C/N ratio of 30. Based on this result, the effects of trace elements (Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+) on biogas production and methane content were also explored. Compared with the group with no addition of trace elements, the experiment adding trace elements had significant enhancement effects on the production of biogas and methane, in which Fe2+ played a leading role (p&lt;0.05). Fe2+ promoted the hydrolysis and acidification of coffee husks, resulting in the production of a series of intermediates such as volatile fatty acids and the other kinds of dissolved organic matter. Furthermore, the cooperation of Ni2+, Co2+ and Fe2+ enhanced the activity of the enzyme system in methanogens, promoting methane production. The results in this paper show that coffee husks have clear biogas potential through anaerobic digestion, and its effective utilization could fulfill the dual purpose of solid waste reclamation and local environmental protection in Ethiopia. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Abstract: The optimization of fermentation parameters for higher yield of bacterial enzymes have significant contribution to the industries. The qualitative enzymatic assay of strain HK2 in xyan agar and xylose agar plates showed a zone of clearance which indicated that the strain has potential to produce xylanase and xylose/glucose isomerase (GI) respectively. The strain produced highest xylanase activity of 23.09 ± 0.009 U/ml when grown in beechwood xylan and yeast extract in a ratio of 3:2 (w/w) at 37 °C and pH 7 for 96 h. Similarly, the strain preferred 35 to 40 °C temperature and 8 to 9 pH for efficient GI production. The GI activity was 3.3 folds higher than control when 1.5% xylose and 1:3 (w/w) ratio of peptone and yeast extract were used in the culture medium. SDS-PAGE of crude enzyme revealed that the molecular weight of xylanase and GI were about 55 kDa and 63 kDa respectively. The strain HK2 was identified as the Serratia marcescens by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The strain has an ability to utilize low cost agricultural residue and the whole cell immobilization of strain improved the enzyme production which can further minimize the cost of down streaming processing. Thus, S. marcescens HK2 could be a promising candidate for foods and biofuels industries. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study employed mesophilic Bacillus subtilis RTS strain isolated from soil with high xylanolytic activity. A 642 bp (xyn) xylanase gene (GenBank accession number MT677937) was extracted from Bacillus subtilis RTS and cloned in Escherichia coli BL21 cells using pET21c expression system. The cloned gene belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 11 with protein size of approximately 23 KDa. The recombinant xylanase showed optimal enzyme activity at 60 °C and at pH 6.5. Thermostability of recombinant xylanase was observed between the temperature range of 30–60 °C. Xylanase also remained stable in different concentration of various organic solvents (ethanol, butanol). This might be due to the formation of protein/organic solvent interface which prevents stripping of essential water molecules from enzyme, thus enzyme conformation and activity remained stable. Finally, the molecular docking analysis through AutoDock Vina showed the involvement of Tyr 108, Arg140 and Pro144 in protein-ligand interaction, which stabilizes this complex. The observed stability of recombinant xylanase at higher temperature and in the presence of organic solvent (ethanol, butanol) suggested possible application of this enzyme in biofuel and other industrial applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fungi of the genus Trichoderma are of high importance for biotechnological applications, in biocontrol and for production of homologous and heterologous proteins. However, sexual crossing under laboratory conditions has so far only been achieved with the species Trichoderma reesei, which was so far only isolated from tropical regions. Our isolation efforts aimed at the collection of Trichoderma strains from Austrian soils surprisingly also yielded 12 strains of the species T. reesei, which was previously not known to occur in Europe. Their identity was confirmed with tef1- and rpb2-sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. They could clearly be distinguished from tropical strains including the common laboratory wildtypes by UP-PCR and genetic variations adjacent to the mating type locus. The strains readily mated with reference strains derived from CBS999.97. Secreted cellulase and xylanase levels of these isolates were up to six-fold higher than those of QM6a indicating a high potential for strain improvement. The strains showed different responses to injury in terms of induction of sporulation, but a correlation to alterations in the nox1-gene sequence was not detected. Several synonymous SNPs were found in the sequence of the regulator gene noxR of the soil isolates compared to QM6a. Only in one strain, non-synonymous SNPs were found which impact a PEST sequence of NoxR, suggesting altered protein stability. The availability of sexually fertile strains from middle Europe naturally producing decent amounts of plant cell wall degrading enzymes opens up novel perspectives for non-GMO strain improvement and biological pretreatment of plant biomass for bioethanol production. Moreover, the varied response of these strains to injury in terms of sporulation, which is independent of Nox1 and NoxR suggests that additional regulators impact this phenomenon in T. reesei. © Copyright © 2021 Hinterdobler, Li, Spiegel, Basyouni-Khamis, Gorfer and Schmoll.

AB  - Given an increasing focus on environmental sustainability, microbial oils have been suggested as an alternative to petroleum-based products. However, microbial oil production relies on the use of costly sugar-based feedstocks. Substrate limitation, elevated costs, and risk of contamination have sparked the search for alternatives to sugar-based platforms. Volatile fatty acids are generated during anaerobic digestion of organic waste and are considered a promising substrate for microbial oil production. In the present study, two freshwater and one marine microalga along with two thraustochytrids were evaluated for their potential to produce lipids when cultivated on volatile fatty acids generated from food waste via anaerobic digestion using a membrane bioreactor. Freshwater microalgae Auxenochlorella protothecoides and Chlorella sorokiniana synthesized lipids rich in palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), and linoleic acid (C18:2). This composition corresponds to that of soybean and jatropha oils, which are used as biodiesel feedstock. Production of added-value polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) mainly omega-3 fatty acids was examined in three different marine strains: Aurantiochytrium sp. T66, Schizochytrium limacinum SR21, and Crypthecodinium cohnii. Only Aurantiochytrium sp. T66 seemed promising, generating 43.19% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 13.56% docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in total lipids. In summary, we show that A. protothecoides, C. sorokiniana, and Aurantiochytrium sp. T66 can be used for microbial oil production from food waste material. © Copyright © 2021 Patel, Mahboubi, Horváth, Taherzadeh, Rova, Christakopoulos and Matsakas.

AB  - The high recalcitrance of plant cell walls is an obstacle for effective chemical or biological conversion into renewable chemicals and transportation fuels. Here, we investigated the utilization of both oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as co-oxidants during alkaline-oxidative pretreatment to improve biomass fractionation and increase enzymatic digestibility. The oxidative pretreatment of hybrid poplar was studied over a variety of conditions. Employing O2 in addition to H2O2 as a co-oxidant during the two-stage alkaline pre-extraction/copper-catalyzed alkaline hydrogen peroxide (Cu-AHP) pretreatment process resulted in a substantial improvement in delignification relative to using H2O2 alone during the second-stage Cu-AHP pretreatment, leading to high overall sugar yields even at H2O2 loadings as low as 2% (w/w of the original biomass). The presence of H2O2, however, was both critical and synergistic. Performing analogous reactions in the absence of H2O2 resulted in approximately 25% less delignification and 30% decrease in sugar yields. The lignin isolated from this dual oxidant second stage had high aliphatic hydroxyl group content and reactivity to isocyanate, indicating that it is a promising substrate for the production of polyurethanes. To test the suitability of the isolated lignin as a source of aromatic monomers, the lignin was subjected to a sequential Bobbitt's salt oxidation followed by a formic acid-catalyzed depolymerization process. Monomer yields of approximately 17% (w/w) were obtained, and the difference in yields was not significant between lignin isolated from our Cu-AHP process with and without O2 as a co-oxidant. Thus, the addition of O2 did not lead to significant lignin crosslinking, a result consistent with the two-dimensional heteronuclear single-quantum coherence NMR spectra of the isolated lignin. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The prospective of this work is to synthesize a new nanocomposite that serves as an electrode material for the immobilization of biomolecules. In this work surface-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (f–COOH–SWCNTs), and hydrothermally synthesized surface defected 2D nanoplates wrapped by polpyrrole matrix was developed. The developed nanocomposite was utilized as the anode material for the immobilization of enzymes. Nanocomposite f-SWCNTs@Ppy@NiMoSe2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The electrochemically controlled bioanode reached to the open circuit potential (OCV) of 0.35 V and delivered the maximum current density of 9.01 mA cm−2 in 50 mM glucose concentration prepared in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (pH 7.0) as the testing solution at 100 mVs−1 scan rates. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The stressed cultivations are widely used in microalgae R&amp;D for the biofuel production with the repress on growth to a certain degree, which limits the overall productivity. The balance between the growth and energy storage compounds accumulation is a target needing the combination of both strain selection or construction and culture optimization. Here, an engineered strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which the chloroplast type glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cGAPDH) was overexpressed and named as P3-GAPDH, was cultured on the Algal Station platform. Compared with wild type (WT), C. reinhardtii CC137c, in Tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium, the highest density of WT and P3-GAPDH were 1.23 ± 0.13 and 1.74 ± 0.09 g L–1 within 96 h, and the maximum biomass productivity was 24.30 ± 1.65 and 28.54 ± 1.43 mg L–1 h–1, respectively. In terms of the energy storage compounds, both carbohydrate and fatty acids content doubled in P3-GAPDH, from 0.13 ± 0.02 to 0.26 ± 0.04 g L–1 for carbohydrate and from 0.08 ± 0.01 to 0.16 ± 0.01 g L–1 for fatty acids, among which poly unsaturated fatty acids increased by 65.8%. Together with the continuous monitor of the chlorophyll fluorescence dynamics parameters Fv/Fm and Fv’/Fm’ and pH of culture, enhanced Calvin cycle by overexpressed cGAPDH promoted the carbon conversion and subsequent energy storage compounds accumulation. C. reinhardtii P3-GAPDH strain showed the potential as a good chassis with high carbon conversion ability. © Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Cao, Li, Rong, Cao and Tian.

AB  - An oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is a promising host for converting lignocellulosic biomass to bioproducts and biofuels. In this work, we performed multi-omics analysis of lignocellulosic carbon utilization in R. toruloides and reconstructed the genome-scale metabolic network of R. toruloides. High-quality metabolic network models for model organisms and orthologous protein mapping were used to build a draft metabolic network reconstruction. The reconstruction was manually curated to build a metabolic model using functional annotation and multi-omics data including transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and RB-TDNA sequencing. The multi-omics data and metabolic model were used to investigate R. toruloides metabolism including lipid accumulation and lignocellulosic carbon utilization. The developed metabolic model was validated against high-throughput growth phenotyping and gene fitness data, and further refined to resolve the inconsistencies between prediction and data. We believe that this is the most complete and accurate metabolic network model available for R. toruloides to date. © Copyright © 2021 Kim, Coradetti, Kim, Gao, Yaegashi, Zucker, Munoz, Zink, Burnum-Johnson, Baker, Simmons, Skerker, Gladden and Magnuson.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most widespread renewable materials in nature. To produce clean and sustainable bioenergy, functional materials and bio-chemicals from lignocellulose, the development of biorefinery in dustry has become the hot topic in recent years. The effective utilization of lignocellulosic biomass can help to relieve the shortage of earth resources, environmental pollution and to achieve the long-term development. Cellulose is the main component of lignocellulosic biomass and the main resource for biorefinery. As a long-chain polysaccharide, cel lulose is self-assembled in plant cell walls as crystalline nanofibers from the linear /3-( 1,4) linked D-glucose poly mers, which can be hydrolyzed to monomelic glucose and eventually be converted to biofuels via microbial fermenta tion or chemical catalysis. However, the complex supramolecular structures of cellulose including allomorphs, crystal- linity and crystal structure, the aggregation of cellulose micro- and macro-fibrils, as well as their multi-interactions with other components (lignin and hemicelluloses) in plant cell walls have formed stable lignocellulosic biomass re calcitrance, inhibiting the bioconversion of cellulose. As the result, biomass pretreatment is necessary for disrupting the complex architecture, swelling the micro- and macro-fibrils and exposing the cellulosic components to make it more accessible to water and cellulase enzymes. The physical, chemical or biological pretreatment firstly facilitates the removal of biomass matrix surrounding the cellulose chains, followed by the disruption of crystalline cellulose fibrils (including the decrystallization, allomorphic transformation and fibrillary separation) , thus contributing high conver sion performance to glucose. This paper reviewed the supramolecular characterizations of cellulose during the pretreat- ments and the mechanisms for enhancement on the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Different changes of cellulose crystal structure during various kinds of pretreatment methods were summarized, which provide the overall understand ing of the relationships of biomass pretreatments and cellulose supramolecular structures. Furthermore, the research progress concerning cellulose aggregations and their chemical linkages with lignin and hemicellulose carbohydrates ma-trix were reviewed. The current challenges and major problems of cellulose structure research during the lignocellulosic biomass utilization were summarized in the last part, including the analytical methods, efficiency improvements of pretreatments as well as the fundamental linkages of carbohydrate polymers in cell walls, which may help for deeper understanding of cell wall components network and full utilization of lignocellulose. © 2021 Nanjing Forestry University.

AB  - Butanol is an important compound used as a building block for producing value-added products and an energy carrier. The main butanol production pathways are conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation and catalytic upgrading of ethanol. On the other hand, the application of biomass as a promising substrate for biofuel production has been widely considered recently. However, few studies have compared different butanol production pathways using biomass as raw material. In light of that, the present work aims (i) to provide a short review of the catalytic ethanol upgrading and (ii) to compare conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading processes from the economic and environmental perspectives. Aspen Plus v9.0 was used to simulate both processes. The economic and environmental assessments were carried out considering the Colombian economic context, a gate-to-gate approach, and single impact categories. Considering a processing scale of 1000 ton/d, the conventional ABE fermentation process presented a more favorable technical, economic, and environmental performance for butanol production from biomass. It also offered lower net energy consumption (i.e., 57.9 GJ/ton of butanol) and higher butanol production (i.e., 2.59 ton/h). Nevertheless, the proposed processing scale was insufficient to reach economic feasibility for both processes. To overcome this challenge, the minimum processing scale had to be higher than 1584 ton/d and 1920 ton/d for conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading, respectively. Another critical factor in enhancing the economic feasibility of both butanol production pathways was the minimum selling price of butanol. More specifically, prices higher than 1.56 USD/kg and 1.80 USD/kg would be required for conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading, respectively. From the environmental impact point of view, the conventional ABE fermentation proc e ss led to a lower potential environmental impact than catalytic ethanol upgrading (0.12 PEI/kg vs. 0.18 PEI/kg, respectively). © 2021 Brteam.

AB  - Diatoms are microalgae well known for their high variability and high primary productivity, being responsible for about 20% of the annual global carbon fixation. Moreover, they are interesting as potential feedstocks for the production of biofuels and high-value lipids and carotenoids. Diatoms exhibit trophic flexibility and, under certain conditions, they can grow mixotrophically by combing photosynthesis and respiration. So far, only a few species of diatoms have been tested for their mixotrophic metabolism; in some cases, they produced more biomass and with higher lipid content when grown under this condition. Phaeodactylum tricornutum is the most studied diatom species for its mixotrophic metabolism due to available genome sequence and molecular tools. However, studies in additional species are needed to better understand the conservation of this process in diatoms and its potential in industrial applications. Here, we describe the photosynthetic and respiratory pathways involved in mixotrophy and provide an overview of the trophic variability in diatoms. This review also highlights promising areas of industrial applications for diatoms when cultivated under mixotrophy. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Biofuels can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and bridging the gap between production and consumption. Ethanol is a renewable source of energy. It can reduce oil dependence and also can be appropriately used in gasoline as a blend. The high cost of dry ethanol has turned the researcher's attention to the more economic hydrous ethanol. However many works were focused on its impact on the engine performance and the exhaust emissions; few works were interested in the phase stability of those blends. This work aims to study the impact of blending cyclohexanol (CH) into hydrous ethanol-gasoline blends as a stabilizing agent. Four dual-alcohol (E5-3CH, E10-3CH, E15-3CH, and E20-3CH) blends were investigated besides their single hydrous ethanol (E0, E5, E10, E15, and E20) blends. The tests involved; water tolerance, distillation curve, and vapor pressure. Vapor lock protection potential, the area under the distillation curve (AUDC), and the area due to azeotrope formation (ADAF) were calculated. The obtained results show that cyclohexanol significantly increases the water tolerance of hydrous ethanol-gasoline blends. The blends of E5 and E10 which were separated at 30 °C converted into miscible and clear samples when they were blended with 3 vol% of cyclohexanol. These samples can also tolerate additional water. For E20, the addition of 3 vol% of cyclohexanol increased the water tolerance by about six times. Also, it was found that cyclohexanol does not have any negative effect on the volatility properties of the fuel blends. It was found that blending CH into the hydrous ethanol blends causes a significant increase in the AUDC and consequently, the area due to azeotrope formation (ADAF) decrease. © 2021 Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute

AB  - Bio-oil is a promising source of chemicals and renewable fuels. As the liquid phase obtained from the pyrolysis of biomass, the composition and amount of bio-oil generated depend not only on the type of the biomass but also on the conditions under which pyrolysis is performed. Most fossil fuels can be replaced by bio-oil-derived products. Thus, bio-oil can be used directly or co-fed along with fossil fuels in boilers, transformed into fuel for car engines by hydrodeoxygenation or even used as a more suitable source for H2 production than biomass. On the other hand, due to its rich composition in compounds resulting from the pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, bio-oil co-acts as a source of various value-added chemicals such as aromatic compounds. This review presents an overview of the potential applications of bio-oils and the pyrolysis conditions under which they are obtained. Then, different extraction methods for value-added chemicals, along with the most recent developments, are discussed and future research directions for bio-oil upgrades are highlighted. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Lignocellulosic feedstocks for biorefinery are likely to be seasonal and the supply of feedstock to cellulosic biorefineries remains a challenge. One way to overcome this is by utilizing a mixed feedstock which facilitates the maintenance of a year-round feedstock supply. This study investigated the impact of mixing of three industrially relevant cellulosic feedstocks—wheat straw, willow and Miscanthus using two major performance indicators—sugar yield and fermentation inhibitor production. A microwave hydrothermal pre-treatment regime of 200 °C for 5 min was applied to each feedstock individually and to 1:1 (w/w) mixes and the predicted sugar yield in the mixes was compared to the observed values. All the mixes resulted in improved sugar yields with willow + Miscanthus (15.4%, p = 0.015) and wheat + willow (13.6%, p = 0.010) showing a statistically significant improvement. Saccharification kinetics, inhibitor production, impact on yeast metabolic activity and growth were compared and no adverse impacts of mixing were observed. The use of mixed feedstocks in a hot water based commercial production of biofuels is unlikely to have any adverse effects on productivity and may indeed prove beneficial. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Increased environmental pollution due to the organic wastes over the world is one of the most burning issues. These organic wastes lie under the category of biodegradable waste and can be effectively degraded from their complex compound into simple one by the action of microbes or other living organisms. Moreover, lignocellulosic biomass is a major part of the biodegradable waste and belongs to the group of renewable energy source, which can be very effective for bioenergy production. Biomasses are made up of different compounds such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin and protein. Apart from these components, based on the structural analysis biomass also consist of bioactive substances such as carotenoids, flavonoids, lignin and antioxidants. This review explores a complete overview of the classification, component and the structure of the biomass. Moreover, it discusses how biomasses can play the key role of substrate in many sectors such as industrial bioenergy production including gaseous and liquid biofuels. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

AB  - The anaerobic digestion of wastes is globally important in the production of methane (CH4) as a biofuel. When sulfate is present, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are stimulated, competing with methanogens for common substrates, which decreases CH4 production and results in the formation of corrosive, odorous hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). Here, we show that a population of SRB within a methanogenic bioreactor fed only butyrate for years immediately (within hours) responded to sulfate availability and shifted the microbial community dynamics within the bioreactor. By mapping shotgun metatranscriptomes to metagenome-assembled genomes, we shed light on the transcriptomic responses of key community members in response to increased sulfate provision. We link these short-term transcriptional responses to long-term niche partitioning using comparative metagenomic analyses. Our results suggest that sulfate provision supports a syntrophic butyrate oxidation community that disfavors poly-β-hydroxyalkanoate storage and that hydrogenotrophic SRB populations effectively exclude obligately hydrogenotrophic, but not aceticlastic, methanogens when sulfate is readily available. These findings elucidate key ecological dynamics between SRB, methanogens and syntrophic butyrate-oxidizing bacteria, which can be applied to a variety of engineered and natural systems. © FEMS 2020.

AB  - Effective use of plant biomass as an abundant and renewable feedstock for biofuel production and biorefinery requires efficient enzymatic mobilization of cell wall polymers. Knowledge of plant cell wall composition and architecture has been exploited to develop novel multifunctional enzymes with improved activity against lignocellulose, where a left-handed β–3-prism synthetic scaffold (BeSS) was designed for insertion of multiple protein domains at the prism vertices. This allowed construction of a series of chimeras fusing variable numbers of a GH11 β-endo-1,4-xylanase and the CipA-CBM3 with defined distances and constrained relative orientations between catalytic domains. The cellulose binding and endoxylanase activities of all chimeras were maintained. Activity against lignocellulose substrates revealed a rapid 1.6- to 3-fold increase in total reducing saccharide release and increased levels of all major oligosaccharides as measured by polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE). A construct with CBM3 and GH11 domains inserted in the same prism vertex showed highest activity, demonstrating interdomain geometry rather than number of catalytic sites is important for optimized chimera design. These results confirm that the BeSS concept is robust and can be successfully applied to the construction of multifunctional chimeras, which expands the possibilities for knowledge-based protein design. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Green macroalgae comprise significant amount of structural carbohydrates for their conversion to liquid biofuels. However, it generally relies on species characteristics and the variability in seasonal profile to determine its route for bioprocessing. Hence, this study was conducted to analyze the indigenous marine macroalgal strain (Ulva prolifera) with respect to periodic trend and reducing sugar extraction. Consequently, in our investigation, the monthly variation in sugar profile and bioethanol yield was assessed between the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, of which relatively high reducing sugar and fermentative bioethanol yield of about 0.152 ± 0.009 g/gdw and 6.275 ± 0.161 g/L was obtained for the October-month isolate (MITM10). Thereafter, the biochemical profile of this collected biomass (MITM10) revealed carbohydrate 34.98 ± 3.30%, protein 12.45 ± 0.49%, and lipid 1.93 ± 0.07%, respectively, on dry weight basis. Of these, the total carbohydrate fraction yielded the maximum reducing sugar of 0.156 ± 0.005 g/gdw under optimal conditions (11.07% (w/v) dosage, 0.9 M H2SO4, 121°C for 50 min) for thermal-acid hydrolysis. Furthermore, the elimination of polysaccharides was confirmed using the characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Therefore, the present thermochemical treatment method provides a species-specific novel strategy to breakdown the macroalgal cell wall polysaccharides that enhances sugar extraction for its utilization as an efficient bioenergy resource. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Production of food, fodder and plant vegetation declined rapidly around the world due to climate change, increase in saline areas and loss of productive lands. A major challenge of sustainable development goals is increasing crop yield and food security by using non-conventional plants in agriculture. Hence, there is a need to develop halophyte based saline agriculture to meet growing demands to feed the world population. Halophytes are the natural inhabitants of salt contaminated degraded soils in diverse environments and offer a multitude of potential applications for sustaining crop productivity. Salt tolerance in halophytes is associated with the plant eco-physiological adaptation that play important roles in their survival and especially adaptation to adverse conditions. Priority attention is required to exploit saline lands and halophytes for economic purposes that will ultimately reduce energy, fresh water and food crises. High nutritional values, resistance to soil containments and production of industrially important products from halophytes offer solutions to apply biotechnological applications that could play an essential role in the production of food, fodder and medicinal supplements. The reclamation of degraded lands, removal of pollutants and the production of alternative energy sources are other emerging fields of applications of these groups of extremophile plants. To increase economic potential and agro-management systems, revegetation and rehabilitation of halophytes are recommended for landscaping, phytoremediation and effluent purification. This review summarizes the perspective of halophytes existence in saline, arid and semi-arid regions as promising alternative sources for industrial applications. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the current study, a domestic food waste containing more than 50% of carbohydrates was assessed as feedstock to produce second-generation bioethanol. Aiming to the maximum exploitation of the carbohydrate fraction of the waste, its hydrolysis via cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymatic blends was investigated and the saccharification efficiency was assessed in each case. Fermentation experiments were performed using the non-conventional yeast Pichia anomala (Wickerhamomyces anomalus) under both separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) modes to evaluate the conversion efficiencies and ethanol yields for different enzymatic loadings. It was shown that the fermentation efficiency of the yeast was not affected by the fermentation mode and was high for all handlings, reaching 83%, whereas the enzymatic blend containing the highest amount of both cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymes led to almost complete liquefaction of the waste, resulting also in ethanol yields reaching 141.06 ± 6.81 g ethanol/kg waste (0.40 ± 0.03 g ethanol/g consumed carbohydrates). In the sequel, a scale-up fermentation experiment was performed with the highest loading of enzymes in SHF mode, from which the maximum specific growth rate, µmax, and the biomass yield, Yx/s, of the yeast from the hydrolyzed waste were estimated. The ethanol yields that were achieved were similar to those of the respective small scale experiments reaching 138.67 ± 5.69 g ethanol/kg waste (0.40 ± 0.01 g ethanol/g consumed carbohydrates). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) have been identified as promising bio-platform furans that have a wide range of potential applications as biofuels, bioplastics, and biochem-icals. Furfural and HMF are typically synthesized from the substrates of C5 sugars and C6 sugars, respectively. Furfural can also be produced from C6 sugars, which is technically more challenging owing to the higher energy requirement for carbon–carbon bond cleavage. In this study, the simultaneous production of furfural and HMF from glucose was conducted over different binary catalyst systems of Brønsted acids and Lewis acids using γ-valerolactone (GVL) as the solvent. A promising performance was achieved by a SnSO4-H2 SO4 coupling catalyst, with an optimized furfural yield of 42% and an HMF yield of 34% at 443 K in GVL. In addition, a kinetics study was performed in order to understand the mechanism of the simultaneous formation of furfural and HMF from glucose at different temperatures and GVL/water ratios. The results showed that the ratio of furfural to HMF production rate at different temperatures (433 to 463 K) or GVL/water ratios (90 to 80%) was constant close to 1, suggesting that the production of furfural and HMF might follow similar reaction pathways. Finally, the reaction pathway of glucose conversion to furfural and HMF was proposed based on the experimental and kinetics studies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biphasic acid hydrolysates and enzymatic hydrolysates from carbohydrate-rich Prosopis juliflora, an invasive perennial deciduous shrub of semi-arid regions, were used for bioethanol production. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis were used for fermentation of hexoses and pentoses. P. juliflora acid hydrolysate with an initial sugar concentration of 18.70 ± 0.16 g/L was concentrated to 33.59 ± 0.52 g/L by vacuum distillation. The concentrated hydrolysate was pretreated and fermented by mono- and co-culture methods either singly or in combination with enzyme hydrolysate and ethanol yields were compared. Monoculture with S. cerevisiae (VS3) and S. cerevisiae (NCIM3455) yielded maximum ethanol of 36.6 ± 1.83 g/L and 37.1 ± 1.86 g/L with a fermentation efficiency of 83.94 ± 4.20% and 84.20 ± 4.21%, respectively, after 36 h of fermentation. The ethanol yield obtained was 0.428 ± 0.02 g/g substrate and 0.429 ± 0.02 g/g substrate with a productivity of 1.017 ± 0.051 g/L/hand 1.031 ± 0.052 g/L/h, respectively. P. stipitis (NCIM3498) yielded maximum ethanol of 24 g/L with ethanol yield of 0.455 ± 0.02 g/g substrate and a productivity of 1.004 ± 0.050 g/L/h after 24 h of fermentation. With concentrated acid hydrolysate as substrate, S. cerevisiae (VS3) produced ethanol of 8.52 ± 0.43 g/L, whereas S. cerevisiae (NCIM3455) produced 5.96 ± 0.30 g/L of ethanol. P.stipitis (NCIM3498) produced 4.52 ± 0.23 g/L of ethanol by utilizing 14.66 ± 0.87 g/L of sugars. Co-culture with S. cerevisiae (VS3) addition after 18 h of addition of P. stipitis (NCIM3498) to the mixture of concentrated acid hydrolysate and enzyme hydrolysate produced 13.86 ± 0.47 g/L of ethanol with fermentation efficiency, ethanol yield and productivity of 87.54 ± 0.54%, 0.446 ± 2.36 g/g substrate and 0.385 ± 0.014 g/L/h, respectively. Hence, it is concluded that co-culture with S. cerevisiae and P. stipitis is feasible, further scaling up of fermentation of P. juliflora substrate for bioethanol production. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - Biocatalytic reduction of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) is considered as a sustainable method and has attracted great attention. In this work, a yeast-like fungus, Aureobasidium subglaciale F134 was discovered as a whole-cell biocatalyst for BHMF synthesis from selective reduction of HMF. Its resting cells exhibited high tolerance and excellent selectivity to HMF in a broad pH range. The catalytic capacity of the cells can be substantially improved by Zn2+ ion. Under the optimized reaction conditions, 180 mM HMF substrate was converted into BHMF with a yield of 82 % and 97 % selectivity in 9 h. In a fed-batch conversion, 430 mM of BHMF product was obtained within 15 h, giving a productivity of 3.7 g/l per hour. In addition, it was found that the cells could also selectively convert furfural to form furfuryl alcohol. Discovery of A. subglaciale F134 cells for BHMF synthesis broadens the biocatalyitc toolbox for sustainable production of bio-based chemicals and biofuels from biomass-derived HMF. In addition, the results provide more information regarding the identification of related enzymes in future work. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Waste biomass for biofuels production can contribute to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and consequently, a decrease of CO2 emissions. In this work, the environmental feasibility of cardoon-to-bioethanol process was evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). For this purpose, three processes involving different biomass pretreatments (dilute acid (DA), single steam explosion (SE) and steam explosion + alkaline extraction (SE + AE)) were simulated by using SuperPro Designer 9.5. Simulation results and literature data were used to perform LCA by using Gabi 6.0 software. LCA results showed that the pretreatment step is the main contributor to the overall impact in the dilute acid case due to the large energy requirements. The use of steam-explosion-based pretreatments drastically reduce environmental impacts regarding to DA process, being fertilizers, chemicals and enzyme production the main important contributors. By combining single steam explosion and subsequent alkaline extraction, the environmental performance is improved compared to single steam explosion due to a reduction of the energy consumption. However, higher toxicity impacts were obtained mainly because of the larger amount of enzyme and chemicals required. GHG emissions and energy balance of bioethanol from cardoon falls within the values reported for similar lignocellulosic raw materials. Finally, the comparative study of bioethanol from cardoon and fossil gasoline indicates that steam explosion-based processes are environmentally superior in most impact categories, obtaining a dramatic reduction of the primary energy demand (80%) and the GHG emissions (45%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Modifying oilseeds to obtain a desired fatty acid composition is often necessary to enable use as feedstocks for specific applications such as food processing, biofuels, or biolubricants. A mutant population of camelina (Camelina sativa), an emerging specialty oilseed crop, was screened by high-throughput gas chromatography for lines with altered seed oil fatty acid composition. By leveraging knowledge of fatty acid synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, mutations in orthologs of FATTY ACID ELONGASE1 (FAE1), FATTY ACID DESATURASE2 (FAD2), FATTY ACID DESATURASE3 (FAD3), and β-KETO-ACYL-ACP SYNTHASE II (KASII; FAB1) were identified. The mutations altered conserved amino acid residues in the encoded proteins. The ability of the mutations in FAE1, FAD2 and FAD3 to affect enzyme function was demonstrated by comparing in vivo activities of wild-type and mutant alleles in yeast. In addition, expression of wild-type cDNA in camelina complemented fatty acid phenotypes of these mutants. As camelina has a hexaploid genome, the effect of a mutation in one of the three homeologs for each gene resulted in no or less severe growth phenotypes compared to similar mutations in Arabidopsis. Mid-oleic oils with nearly 40 % oleic acid and reduced very long-chain (≤C20) fatty acid content were obtained by crossing to obtain a fae1c/fad2a/fae1a/fad3a quadruple mutant. Little effect on total seed oil content was observed in the stacked mutant line. The resulting mid-oleic acid oil had improved oxidative stability due to reductions in polyunsaturated fatty acid content, increasing its utility for biofuels and other applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present investigation aims towards simultaneous increase in biomass and carbohydrate accumulation of Anabaena variabilis by formulating an optimal growth condition. Based on the individual factor studies, concentrations of three variables were optimized. An initial pH 8.9, 168.8 mg L−1 MgSO4, and 64.3 mg L−1 NaHCO3 were the best combination resulting in respective ∼1.5 and ∼2.4-fold higher biomass and total carbohydrate yield compared to BG-11-grown control. Carbohydrate profiling indicated ∼2.6-fold rise in the yield of reducing sugar and glycogen. The bioethanol yield was, therefore, enhanced by ∼2.5-fold, reflecting almost two-times higher the value obtained earlier using the biphasic approach. The optimized condition also heightened the yield of the co-products C-phycocyanin and sodium copper chlorophyllin by ∼3-fold, and poly-β-hydroxybutyrate and exopolysaccharides by ∼2.6 and ∼1.8-fold. A ∼60% greater earning was projected from both bioethanol and co-products using the optimal medium under the large-scale set-up compared to control. Thus the present work engineered a robust way to maximize bioethanol production within a shortened time spell, ruling out the constraints of nutrient starvation under biphasic strategies alongside economizing the production process incorporating cyanobacterial refinery approach. Additionally, the details on photobioreactor prospects and sustainability assessment using ‘Water footprint’ would be beneficial for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The partially purified lipase from Aspergillus oryzae ST11 was immobilized on the surface-modified electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous membrane. The effects of time and concentrations of glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied. The immobilized lipase reached the maximum activity at 180 min with the recovered activity of 44.2% (0.22 U/mg-support) in the absence of BSA. After adding 6 mg/mL BSA and 40 mM glutaraldehyde gave the recovered activity at 86.9% (0.43 U/mg-support). It showed the highest stability at pH 7.5 but the soluble lipase was at pH 7.0. In addition, the immobilized lipase was more stable at pH 4.0 and 9.0. The immobilized lipase preserved 56% activity at 70 °C but the soluble lipase had 34% activity. It conserved 86% activity while the soluble lipase had 18% activity after 13 days of storage at 4 °C. The operating parameters such as biocatalyst concentration, water content, and the molar ratio of methanol and palm oil were optimized for biodiesel production. The highest biodiesel conversion (95%) was obtained with the immobilized lipase 15% (w/w), 40% (w/w) 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.0 and methanol/palm oil (3.5:1.0). This immobilized lipase could be reused with 82.9% conversion after 10 cycles of batch production. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion represents an interesting approach to produce biogas from organic waste materials contaminated by mycotoxins. In this study a shotgun metagenomic analysis of lab-scale bioreactors fed with mycotoxin-contaminated silage has been carried out to characterize the evolution of microbial community under the operating conditions and the key enzymatic activities responsible for mycotoxin degradation. The study was conducted at two different level of contamination for fumonisins and aflatoxin B1. After 15 days biogas production was not influenced by the presence of mycotoxins. Metagenomic analysis revealed that a high contamination rate of mycotoxins interfere with microbial diversity. Degradation of mycotoxins accounted in about 54% for aflatoxin B1 and 60% for fumonisins. The degradation activity of fumonisins resulted in the presence of partially hydrolyzed forms in both tested contamination levels. Accordingly, metagenomic functional analysis revealed the presence of two new carboxylesterase genes belonging to D. bacterium and P. bacterium putatively involved in fumonisin degradation. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Biofuel cells generate electric energy using an enzyme as a catalyst for an electrode but their stability and low battery output pose problems for practical use. To solve these problems, this study aimed to build a long-lasting and high-output biocathode as a catalyst using a highly stable hyperthermophilic archaeal enzyme, multi-copper oxidase, from Pyrobaculum aerophilum (McoP). To increase output, McoP was oriented and immobilized on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) with a high specific surface area, and the electrode interface was designed to achieve highly efficient electron transfer between the enzyme and electrode. Type 1 copper (T1Cu), an electron-accepting site in the McoP molecule, is located near the C-terminus. Therefore, McoP was prepared by genetically engineering a CNT-binding peptide with the sequence LLADTTHHRPWT, at the C-terminus of McoP (McoP-CBP). We then constructed an electrode using a complex in which McoP-CBP was aligned and immobilized on SWCNT, and then clarified the effect of CBP. The amounts of immobilized enzymes on McoP-SWCNT and (McoP-CBP)-SWCNT complexes were almost equal. CV measurement of the electrode modified with both complexes showed 5.4 times greater current density in the catalytic reaction of the (McoP-CBP)-SWCNT/GC electrode than in the McoP-SWCNT/GC electrode. This is probably because CBP fusion immobilize the enzyme on SWCNTs in an orientational manner, and T1Cu, the oxidation–reduction site in McoP, is close to the electrode, which improves electron transfer efficiency. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Dye decolourizing peroxidase (DyP) is an emerging biocatalyst with enormous bioremediation and biotechnological potentials. This study examined the global trend of research related to DyP through a bibliometric analysis. The search term ‘dye decolourizing peroxidase’ or ‘DyP-type peroxidase’ was used to retrieve published articles between 2007 and 2019 from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. A total of 62 articles were published within the period, with an annual growth rate of 17·6%. The highest research output was observed in 2015, which accounted for about 13% of the total output in 12 years. Germany published the highest number of articles (n = 10, 16·1%) with a total citation of 478. However, the lowest number of published articles among the top 10 countries was observed in India and Korea (n = 2, 3·2%). Research collaboration was low (collaboration index = 4·08). In addition to dye decolourizing peroxidase(s) and DyP-type peroxidase(s) (n = 33, 53·23%), the top authors keywords and research focus included lignin and lignin degradation (n = 10, 16·1 %). More so, peroxidase (n = 59, 95·2%), amino acid sequence (n = 27, 46·8%), lignin (n = 24, 38·7%) and metabolism (n = 23, 37·1%) were highly represented in keywords-plus. The most common conceptual framework from this study include characterization, lignin degradation and environmental proteomics. Apart from the inherent efficient dye-decolourizing properties, this study showed that DyP has emerging biotechnological potentials in lignin degradation and remediation of phenolic environmental pollutants, which at the moment are under explored globally. © 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Kitchen waste (KW) has gradually become a prominent problem in municipal solid waste treatment. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising method used to make fuel oil from food and KW. However, the upgrading of bio-oil is particularly important for the sake of industrial reuse. In this study, the KW from university restaurants was subjected to HTL experiments in order to study theoretical feasibility. With the change of conversion temperature and residence time, the optimal conversion working conditions in this study were determined according to the quality and yield of the bio-oil. Moreover, the bio-oil upgrading effects of different additives (hydrogen chloride, sodium hydroxide, and iron(III) chloride) on the HTL of KW were studied. Alkaline additives have an inhibitory effect on the bio-oil yield and positive effect on coke yield. Acidic additives and iron (Fe)-containing additives can promote bio-oil yield. As an important aspect of upgrading, the effect on the nitrogen content of bio-oil with additives was revealed. The alkaline and Fe-containing additives have little effect on reducing the viscosity of the bio-oil while with the appropriate ratio (2.5 mol•kg−1) of acidic additives to the raw material, the static and dynamic fluidity of the oil phase products are reduced to about 0.1 Pa•s. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Significant components of cost-effective medium for Magnusiomyces capitatus A4C extracellular lipase (ECL) production were optimized via a five-level factorial design. A simplistic, economical, and green approach was adopted for biomimetic mineralization to prepare multilayered nano-entrapped ECL, which were then applied as biocatalysts for the production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The optimal ECL (0.8 mg protein/mL) and CuSO4∙5H2O (1.2 mM) showed the highest capacity for enzyme loading. The ECL-CuSO4-hybrid showed an 89.7% conversion of triacylglycerides into FAME via transesterification and a 98.7% conversion of oleic acid into FAME via esterification at 72 h. The ECL-CuSO4-hybrid gave 65% and 78.7% FAME production after 5 successive reuses via transesterification and esterification reactions, respectively. Therefore, these ECL-inorganic hybrid biocatalysts have high economical potential to be used for the production of biodiesel as the future petrodiesel replacement. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aims: Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a diverse superfamily that hydrolyzes fatty acyl ester bonds at the sn-2 position of phospholipids. The correlation between phospholipid metabolism and the anabolism of neutral lipids remains unclear in yeasts. This study aims to explore the effects of PLA2 on lipid accumulation in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. Methods and Results: This study identified an actively expressed phospholipase A2 gene (PLA2-3, YAIL0_E16060g) in Y. lipolytica by quantitative PCR analysis. The gene PLA2-3 was disrupted in the strain po1gΔKu70 by homologous recombination and in the strain po1g-G3 by a CRISPR-Cas9 system, which caused an increase in stress sensitivity while the cell growth was not altered under fermentative conditions. Lipid production was performed in both flasks and bioreactors. The results showed that the lipid titre and lipid content were improved over 25% and 8–30%, respectively, in PLA2-3 disrupted strains compared to the controls. Conclusions: Disruption of the phospholipase PLA2-3 gene could effectively improve lipid production in Y. lipolytica. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study presented a strategy on improving the lipid production of oleaginous yeasts and a similar strategy might be used in other oleaginous microbes. © 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Biodiesel, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), is an environmentally friendly alternative fuel produced by transesterification of renewable lipid feedstocks for diesel engines. Methanolysis of waste frying oil (WFO) was catalyzed by Rhizopus stolonifer 1aNRC11 mutant F whole-cell lipase that produced under solid state fermentation (SSF) using wheat bran (WB) and black cumin meal as the main substrate. Cultivation SSF parameters of R. stolonifer mutant were optimized using Plackett-Burman (PB) experimental design and Face-centred Central Composite Design (FCCD), taking FAME yield as a response for whole-cell lipase production ability. PB results showed that cultivation temperature, medium pH and moisture content were the most significant parameters, which were selected for optimization by FCCD. The optimal determined conditions were as follows: WB (10 g), black cumin meal (6%, w/w of WB), fodder yeast (1%, w/w of WB), moisture content (1.5 g water/g solid), inoculum size (3 discs), initial pH (8), and cultivation time (4 day) at 28 °C. With R. stolonifer mutant cultivated in the optimized conditions, the FAME yield reached 82.6% that was close to the predicted yield of 85.7%. The analysis of variance showed that the model was statistically significant (p value of.0001) and could explain 89% of the variability in the response. These results indicated that the optimization conditions increased biodiesel production by about 43% compared to the basal medium (57.60%). The optimization of SSF conditions using low cost components makes the whole-cell lipase production process from the R. stolonifer 1aNRC11 mutant F economically effective for application in biodiesel production from WFO. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - β-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) have been described as essential to second-generation biofuel production. They act in the last step of the lignocellulosic saccharification, cleaving the β − 1,4 glycosidic bonds in cellobiose to produce two molecules of glucose. However, β-glucosidases have been described as strongly inhibited by glucose, causing an increment of cellobiose concentration. Also, cellobiose is an inhibitor of other enzymes used in this process, such as exoglucanases and endoglucanases. Hence, the engineering of thermostable and glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases has been targeted by many studies. In this study, we performed high sampling accelerated molecular dynamics for a wild glucose-tolerant GH1 β-glucosidase (Bgl1A), a wild non-tolerant (Bgl1B), and a set of glucose-tolerant Bgl1B’s mutants: V302F, N301Q/V302F, F172I, V227M, G246S, T299S, and H228T. Our results suggest that point mutations promissory to induce glucose tolerance trend to enhance the mobility of the flexible loops around the active site. Mutations affected B and C loops regions, and an αβ-hairpin motif between them. Conformational clusters and free energy landscape profiles suggest that the mobility acquired by mutants allows a higher closure of the substrate channel. This closure is compatible with a higher impedance for glucose entrance and stimulus of its withdrawal. Based on mutants’ structural analyses, we inferred that both the direct stereochemical effect on the glucose path and the changes in the mobility affect glucose tolerance. We hope these results be useful for the rational design of glucose-tolerant and industrially promising enzymes. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass enhances the conversion efficiency to produce biofuels and value-added chemicals, which have the potential to replace fossil fuels. Compared to physicochemical and other pretreatment techniques, the hydrothermal methods are considered eco-friendly and cost-effective. This paper reviews the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of steam explosion and subcritical water hydrolysis as the two promising hydrothermal technologies for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Although the principle of the steam explosion in depolymerizing the lignin and exposing the cellulose fibers for bioconversion to liquid fuels is well known, its underlying mechanism for solid biofuel production is less identified. Therefore, this review provides an insight into different operating conditions of steam explosion and subcritical water hydrolysis for a wide variety of feedstocks. The mechanisms of subcritical water hydrolysis including dehydration, decarboxylation and carbonization of waste biomass are comprehensively described. Finally, the role of microwave heating in the hydrothermal pretreatment of biomass is elucidated. © 2021

AB  - Background: Engineering triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in vegetative tissues of non-food crops has become a promising way to meet our increasing demand for plant oils, especially the renewable production of biofuels. The most important target modified in this regard is diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzyme responsible for the final rate-limiting step in TAG biosynthesis. Cyperus esculentus is a unique plant largely accumulating oleic acid-enriched oil in its underground tubers. We speculated that DGAT derived from such oil-rich tubers could function more efficiently than that from oleaginous seeds in enhancing oil storage in vegetative tissues of tobacco, a high-yielding biomass crops. Results: Three CeDGAT genes namely CeDGAT1, CeDGAT2-1 and CeDGAT2-2 were identified in C. esculentus by mining transcriptome of developing tubers. These CeDGATs were expressed in tissues tested, with CeDGAT1 highly in roots, CeDGAT2-1 abundantly in leaves, and CeDGAT2-2 predominantly in tubers. Notably, CeDGAT2-2 expression pattern was in accordance with oil dynamic accumulation during tuber development. Overexpression of CeDGAT2-2 functionally restored TAG biosynthesis in TAG-deficient yeast mutant H1246. Oleic acid level was significantly increased in CeDGAT2-2 transgenic yeast compared to the wild-type yeast and ScDGA1-expressed control under culture with and without feeding of exogenous fatty acids. Overexpressing CeDGAT2-2 in tobacco led to dramatic enhancements of leafy oil by 7.15- and 1.7-fold more compared to the wild-type control and plants expressing Arabidopsis seed-derived AtDGAT1. A substantial change in fatty acid composition was detected in leaves, with increase of oleic acid from 5.1% in the wild type to 31.33% in CeDGAT2-2-expressed tobacco and accompanied reduction of saturated fatty acids. Moreover, the elevated accumulation of oleic acid-enriched TAG in transgenic tobacco exhibited no significantly negative impact on other agronomic traits such as photosynthesis, growth rates and seed germination except for small decline of starch content. Conclusions: The present data indicate that CeDGAT2-2 has a high enzyme activity to catalyze formation of TAG and a strong specificity for oleic acid-containing substrates, providing new insights into understanding oil biosynthesis mechanism in plant vegetative tissues. Overexpression of CeDGAT2-2 alone can significantly increase oleic acid-enriched oil accumulation in tobacco leaves without negative impact on other agronomy traits, showing CeDGAT2-2 as the desirable target gene in metabolic engineering to enrich oil and value-added lipids in high-biomass plants for commercial production of biofuel oils. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cumulative reported evidence has indicated that renewable feedstocks are a promising alternative source to fossil platforms for the production of fuels and chemicals. In that regard, the development of new, highly active, selective, and easy to recover and reuse catalysts for biomass conversions is urgently needed. The combination of enzymatic and inorganic heterogeneous catalysis generates an unprecedented platform that combines the advantages of both, the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of enzymes with the ordered structure, high porosity, mechanical, thermal and chemical resistance of mesoporous materials to obtain enzymatic heterogeneous catalysts. Enzymatic mineralization with an organic silicon precursor (biosilicification) is a promising and emerging approach for the generation of solid hybrid biocatalysts with exceptional stability under severe use conditions. Herein, we assessed the putative advantages of the biosilicification technology for developing an improved efficient and stable biocatalyst for sustainable biofuel production. Results: A series of solid enzymatic catalysts denominated LOBE (low ordered biosilicified enzyme) were synthesized from Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase and tetraethyl orthosilicate. The microscopic structure and physicochemical properties characterization revealed that the enzyme formed aggregates that were contained in the heart of silicon-covered micelles, providing active sites with the ability to process different raw materials (commercial sunflower and soybean oils, Jatropha excisa oil, waste frying oil, acid oil from soybean soapstock, and pork fat) to produce first- and second-generation biodiesel. Ester content ranged from 81 to 93% wt depending on the raw material used for biodiesel synthesis. Conclusions: A heterogeneous enzymatic biocatalyst, LOBE4, for efficient biodiesel production was successfully developed in a single-step synthesis reaction using biosilicification technology. LOBE4 showed to be highly efficient in converting refined, non-edible and residual oils (with high water and free fatty acid contents) and ethanol into biodiesel. Thus, LOBE4 emerges as a promising tool to produce second-generation biofuels, with significant implications for establishing a circular economy and reducing the carbon footprint. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Conventional aqueous dilute sulfuric acid (DSA) pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass facilitates hemicellulose solubilization and can improve subsequent enzymatic digestibility of cellulose to fermentable glucose. However, much of the lignin after DSA pretreatment either remains intact within the cell wall or readily redeposits back onto the biomass surface. This redeposited lignin has been shown to reduce enzyme activity and contribute to rapid enzyme deactivation, thus, necessitating significantly higher enzyme loadings than deemed economical for biofuel production from biomass. Results: In this study, we demonstrate how detrimental lignin redeposition on biomass surface after pretreatment can be prevented by employing Co-solvent Enhanced Lignocellulosic Fractionation (CELF) pretreatment that uses THF–water co-solvents with dilute sulfuric acid to solubilize lignin and overcome limitations of DSA pretreatment. We first find that enzymatic hydrolysis of CELF-pretreated switchgrass can sustain a high enzyme activity over incubation periods as long as 5 weeks with enzyme doses as low as 2 mg protein/g glucan to achieve 90% yield to glucose. A modified Ninhydrin-based protein assay revealed that the free-enzyme concentration in the hydrolysate liquor, related to enzyme activity, remained unchanged over long hydrolysis times. DSA-pretreated switchgrass, by contrast, had a 40% drop in free enzymes in solution during incubation, providing evidence of enzyme deactivation. Furthermore, measurements of enzyme adsorption per gram of lignin suggested that CELF prevented lignin redeposition onto the biomass surface, and the little lignin left in the solids was mostly integral to the original lignin–carbohydrate complex (LCC). Scanning electron micrographs and NMR characterization of lignin supported this observation. Conclusions: Enzymatic hydrolysis of solids from CELF pretreatment of switchgrass at low enzyme loadings was sustained for considerably longer times and reached higher conversions than for DSA solids. Analysis of solids following pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis showed that prolonged cellulase activity could be attributed to the limited lignin redeposition on the biomass surface making more enzymes available for hydrolysis of more accessible glucan. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - A regulatable bioremediation capsule material was synthesized with isolated single-strain bacteria (Bacillus species, B. CMC1) and a regulator molecule (carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC) by a vapor-phased encapsulation method with simple steps of water sublimation and poly-p-xylylene deposition in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Mechanically, the capsule construct exhibited a controllable shape and dimensions, and was composed of highly biocompatible poly-p-xylylene as the matrix with homogeneously distributed bacteria and CMC molecules. Versatility of the encapsulation of the molecules at the desired concentrations was achieved in the vapor-phased sublimation and deposition fabrication process. The discovery of the fabricated capsule revealed that viable living B. CMC1 inhabited the capsule, and the capsule enhanced bacterial growth due to the materials and process used. Biologically, the encapsulated B. CMC1 demonstrated viable and functional enzyme activity for cellulase activation, and such activity was regulatable and proportional to the concentration of the decorated CMC molecules in the same capsule construct. Impressively, 13% of cellulase activity increase was realized by encapsulation of B. CMC1 by poly-p-xylylene, and a further 34% of cellulase activity increase was achieved by encapsulation of additional 2.5% CMC. Accordingly, this synergistic effectiveness of the capsule constructs was established by combining enzymatic B. CMC1 bacteria and its regulatory CMC by poly-p-xylylene encapsulation process. This reported encapsulation process exhibited other advantages, including the use of simple steps and a dry and clean process free of harmful chemicals; most importantly, the process is scalable for mass production. The present study represents a novel method to fabricate bacteria-encapsulated capsule for cellulose degradation in bioremediation that can be used in various applications, such as wastewater treatment and transforming of cellulose into glucose for biofuel production. Moreover, the concept of this vapor-phased encapsulation technology can be correspondingly used to encapsulate multiple bacteria and regulators to enhance the specific enzyme functions for degradation of various organic matters. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Cellobiose dehydrogenase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PcCDH) is a key enzyme in lignocellulose depolymerization, biosensors and biofuel cells. For these applications, it should retain important molecular and catalytic properties when recombinantly expressed. While homologous expression is time-consuming and the prokaryote Escherichia coli is not suitable for expression of the two-domain flavocytochrome, the yeast Pichia pastoris is hyperglycosylating the enzyme. Fungal expression hosts like Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei were successfully used to express CDH from the ascomycete Corynascus thermophilus. This study describes the expression of basidiomycetes PcCDH in T. reesei (PcCDHTr) and the detailed comparison of its molecular, catalytic and electrochemical properties in comparison with PcCDH expressed by P. chrysosporium and P. pastoris (PcCDHPp). Results: PcCDHTr was recombinantly produced with a yield of 600 U L−1 after 4 days, which is fast compared to the secretion of the enzyme by P. chrysosporium. PcCDHTr and PcCDH were purified to homogeneity by two chromatographic steps. Both enzymes were comparatively characterized in terms of molecular and catalytic properties. The pH optima for electron acceptors are identical for PcCDHTr and PcCDH. The determined FAD cofactor occupancy of 70% for PcCDHTr is higher than for other recombinantly produced CDHs and its catalytic constants are in good accordance with those of PcCDH. Mass spectrometry showed high mannose-type N-glycans on PcCDH, but only single N-acetyl-d-glucosamine additions at the six potential N-glycosylation sites of PcCDHTr, which indicates the presence of an endo-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase in the supernatant. Conclusions: Heterologous production of PcCDHTr is faster and the yield higher than secretion by P. chrysosporium. It also does not need a cellulose-based medium that impedes efficient production and purification of CDH by binding to the polysaccharide. The obtained high uniformity of PcCDHTr glycoforms will be very useful to investigate electron transfer characteristics in biosensors and biofuel cells, which are depending on the spatial restrictions inflicted by high-mannose N-glycan trees. The determined catalytic and electrochemical properties of PcCDHTr are very similar to those of PcCDH and the FAD cofactor occupancy is good, which advocates T. reesei as expression host for engineered PcCDH for biosensors and biofuel cells. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The production of chemicals and fuels from renewable biomass with the primary aim of reducing carbon footprints has recently become one of the central points of interest. The use of lignocellulosic biomass for energy production is believed to meet the main criteria of maximizing the available global energy source and minimizing pollutant emissions. However, before usage in bioenergy production, lignocellulosic biomass needs to undergo several processes, among which biomass pretreatment plays an important role in the yield, productivity, and quality of the products. Acid-based pretreatment, one of the existing methods applied for lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment, has several advantages, such as short operating time and high efficiency. A thorough analysis of the characteristics of acid-based biomass pretreatment is presented in this review. The environmental concerns and future challenges involved in using acid pretreatment methods are discussed in detail to achieve clean and sustainable bioenergy production. The application of acid to biomass pretreatment is considered an effective process for biorefineries that aim to optimize the production of desired products while minimizing the by-products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The biomass ‘waste-to-energy theory transforms low-value biomass within value-added outputs which include high financial potential has drawn awareness from both academicians and enterprise professionals. The biomass waste administration method involves the production, chamber, acquisition, transferal, and conveyor, processing, and distribution of all classes of trash. However, most of these methods are yet under the growing state and attempting to acquire a business partly due to several hurdles, such as proper infrastructure, feedstock, technological conditions, administration management, and communal recognition. Recently, thermochemical methods towards agricultural biomass to power conversion appear encouraging and achievable. The comparative benefit of thermochemical transformation above others is higher potency and adaptability among subsisting infrastructure tools. These advantages differ by method and final product, presenting compliance in matching market necessities. Advantages include environmental change: upon a life-cycle base, high-level biofuels generated through thermochemical transformation could decrease greenhouse gases by around 50% or higher than traditional gasoline. In this article, a comprehensive report on the advancement of the five most encouraging ways of thermochemical transformation (i.e. incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, plasma, and torrefaction), three ways of biochemical renovation (i.e. composting, bioethanol fermentation and anaerobic digestion) and landfill methane capture have been discussed. The modern evolution of several conversion technologies for biomass regeneration has also been examined and benchmarked towards global development. Additionally, the core scientific hurdles in profiting these green pieces of machinery are emphasized. © 2021

AB  - Life cycle assessments of fuel bioethanol produced in Uruguay from liquid hot water pretreated switchgrass were performed for two scenarios: the production of ethanol and electricity and a biorefinery producing ethanol, electricity, furfural, acetic, and formic acid. Experimental data and material and energy balances derived from the simulations were used to analyze the global warming potential of fuel bioethanol. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in both scenarios were lower than the reference emissions for fossil fuel. The biorefinery scenario had a better performance in terms of environmental impacts, and the biofuel produced met GHG reduction requirements. Switchgrass composition, enzyme dosage, fermentation and hydrolysis efficiency, and solids content had a significant effect on environmental performance, with enzyme use being the most significant factor. A multi-objective optimization was used to find the values of solid content and enzyme dose that minimize GHG emissions and the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP). An enzyme dosage of 37 mgprotein/gglucan and solids content of 21% w/w were the optimal conditions for bioethanol production with an associated GHG value of 2 ± 5 g CO2 eq./MJethanol and a MESP of $0.84/L. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A glucose oxidation catalyst comprising carbon nanotube, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), gelatin, glutaraldehyde (GA) and glucose oxidase (GOx) (CNT/[TTF-GOx]/Gelatin + GA) is suggested to enhance the reactivity of glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), and the performance and stability of enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs) using this catalyst. In this catalyst, TTF is used as mediator to transfer electron effectively, while GA is crosslinked to gelatin to form non-soluble network. The structure prevents the dissolution of gelatin from aqueous electrolyte and reduces the leaching-out of GOx and TTF molecules. To confirm the crosslinking effect of GA and gelatin, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and electrochemical evaluations are utilized. According to FT-IR analysis, it was observed that the amide I peak shifted after crosslinking. This is evidence showing the appropriate network formation and the reactivity of CNT/[TTF-GOx]/Gelatin + GA is well preserved even after multiple potential cycling. In addition, its GOx activity is regularly monitored for one month and the measurements prove that the structure prevents the leaching out of GOx molecules. Based on that, EBC using the anodic catalyst shows excellent performances, such as open circuit voltage of 0.75 V and maximum power density of 184 μW/cm2. © 2021 Science Press

AB  - The study of biomass is extremely important, aiming to discover the potential of alternative source that are capable of promoting the development of new technologies. The thermal behavior and chemical characteristics of the Capsicum waste from the use for the manufacture of sauces and condiments were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis, higher heating values, ignition (Ti) and burnout temperatures (Tb) and kinetic study using isoconversional models. Torrefaction and pyrolysis conditions were applied. Characterization based on ultimate and proximate analysis, gravimetric and gravimetric yield factor were also realized. Thermal analysis showed a biomass conversion between 150 °C and 500 °C. Proximate analysis identified an average volatile content of 46.5%, and carbon and fixed carbon were 22.3 and 31.1%, respectively. Gravimetric yield varied between 28 and 58%. Considering the intersection model, ignition and burnout temperature varied between 342–354 °C and 470–503 °C, respectively. The deviation model found an ignition temperature between 210 and 249 °C. Biomass proved to be a possible source of biofuel with a significant economic potential. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Seaweeds have been used in many biotechnological applications including animal feed, human food, cosmetics, fertilizers, and bioremediation. With respect to bioremediation, seaweeds contaminated with heavy metals have limited applications and most suited for biofuel production. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of seaweeds for dual use in heavy metal biosorption and biofuel production. Three dominant seaweed genera were collected representing the three macroalgal phyla, namely Ulva spp. (Chlorophyte), Gracilaria spp. (Rhodophyte), and Sargassum spp. (Phaeophyte). The later showed the highest cumulative copper (Cu2+) biosorption with 80% removal efficiency, which increased to 94.6% after process optimization. Comparative fermentation of raw biomass (RB) and Cu-sorbed biomass (BHM) showed the highest bioethanol yield of 289.2 mg g−1 for RB at 72 h fermentation, which was 24.3% higher than that of BHM. In addition, the presence of Cu2+ in the BHM showed significant reduction in biogas and biomethane yields by 18.4% and 5.2%, respectively, with respect to RB. However, fermented BHM showed higher biogas and biomethane yields than the fermented RB. Due to dual bioethanol and biogas production, sequential fermentation and anaerobic digestion of Cu-sorbed biomass showed the highest energy output of 1597.3 GJ year−1. The present study suggests a novel approach that provides an integrated method for efficient utilization of seaweeds biomass in wastewater treatment and sustainable energy recovery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestion processes create biogases that can be useful sources of energy. The development of data-driven models of anaerobic digestion processes via operating parameters can lead to increased biogas production rates, resulting in greater energy production, through process modification and optimization. This study assessed processed and unprocessed input operating parameter variables for the development of regression models with transparent structures (‘white-box’ models) to: (1) estimate biogas production rates from municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) anaerobic digestors; (2) compare their performances to artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models with opaque structures (‘black-box’ models) using Monte Carlo Simulation for uncertainty analysis; and (3) integrate the models with a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize operating parameters for maximization of MWTP biogas production rates. The input variables were anaerobic digestion operating parameters from a MWTP including volatile fatty acids, total/fixed/volatile solids, pH, and inflow rate, which were processed via correlation tests and principal component analysis. Overall, the results indicated that the processed data did not improve regression model performances. Additionally, the developed non-linear regression model with the unprocessed inputs had the best performance based on values including R = 0.81, RMSE = 0.95, and IA = 0.89. However, this model was less accurate, but interestingly had less uncertainty, as compared to ANN and ANFIS models which indicates the compromise between model accuracy and uncertainty. Thus, all three models were coupled with GA optimization with maximum biogas production rate estimates of 22.0, 23.1, and 28.6 m3/min for ANN, ANFIS, and non-linear regression models, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fourth generation (4G) biofuels have been found compatible with engines, storage systems, and transport facilities. Due to advances in synthetic biology and genetic engineering tools, considerable progress has been made in producing 4G biofuels including high-carbon alcohols, long-chain hydrocarbons, terpenoids-based, and/or fatty-acid derived biofuels using Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Yarrowia lypolytica, and Zymomonas mobilis as microbial cellular factories. However, these microbial platforms face various challenges including low product titers, low product yields, difficult product recovery incurring intensive energy consumption, and discharge of large amounts of wastewater. All these issues make the production and recovery of these biofuels expensive and commercially non-competitive. However, various genetic manipulation approaches including overexpression of heat-shock proteins, enhanced production of precursor molecules, regulating redox-balance, and membrane engineering have been employed to cope with these challenges. This review discusses the progress made in the molecular approaches for the enhanced biosynthesis and easier recovery of these biofuels through employing the secreting microbial cell factories. Besides, based on the data published on membrane transporters in previous fifteen years, selected fungal and bacterial membrane efflux pumps are studied to evaluate their biofuel secretion potential as future targets to be employed in the biofuel secreting microbial cell factories to achieve commercial robustness in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The thermal applications of nanofluids significantly improved the heat and mass transfer pattern which convey necessary role in many engineering and industrial zones. The consideration of nanofluids contributes many dynamic applications in the solar energy and thermal engineering problems. Moreover, the stability of nanofluids is enhanced perfectively with motile microorganisms which have applications in petroleum sciences, biofuels, bio-engineering, bio-medical, enzymes etc. This research determines the applications of bio-convection in Casson nanoliquid flow subject to the variable thermal conductivity and inertial forces. The Cattaneo-Christov relations are treated to modify the heat and concentration equations. The accelerated surface with sinusoidal type velocity induced the flow. The flow problem is formulated in terms of partial differential equations. The homotopic scheme is followed in order to suggest the analytical relations. After highlighting the convergence region, the graphical simulations with help of MATHEMAITCA are performed. The physical output is addressed in view of all flow parameters. The 3-D behavior of velocity, temperature, concentration and microorganisms is also addressed. © 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This present research aims at developing an efficient and reusable base catalyst to improve the biodiesel production for the need of green chemistry and sustainable development. To achieve this, the copolymer, namely poly(allylglycidyl ether-divinylbenzene-glycidyl methacrylate) (poly(AGE-DVB-GMA)), was firstly incorporated in the Fe3O4 nanoparticles forming magnetic Fe3O4-poly(AGE-DVB-GMA) composites, and then organic guanidine was bound on the magnetic matrices via covalent bonds with active epoxy groups. The characterization of the as-made magnetic copolymer support and solid base catalysts was performed by several techniques, and the results revealed that the guanidine base was successfully tethered on the magnetic copolymer support. This developed solid catalyst possessed large surface basicity of 2.45 mmol/g and highly magnetic responsiveness with saturation magnetization value of 18.13 emu/g, displaying good activity to the transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel in a heterogeneous manner. Under the transesterification conditions of methanol/oil molar ratio of 20:1, catalyst dosage of 7 wt%, reaction temperature of 65 °C, reaction duration of 8 h, the biodiesel yield of 92.6% was attained over the guanidine-based solid catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst could be easily separated under an external magnetic field, and showed satisfactory catalytic activity even after four reuse cycles, thus posing considerable potential for the sustainable and clean production of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic co-digestion of a cow manure-cotton straw mixture (CCM) has been shown to promote methanogenesis, but the recalcitrant crystal structure of organic polymers in CCM hinders its hydrolysis during anaerobic digestion (AD). Here, the efficacy of different pretreatment methods based on potassium ferrate (PF) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) was evaluated to facilitate CCM decomposition and methanogenesis during AD. The maximum lignocellulosic removal rate (62.5%), the highest volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (7769.6 mg/L), and cumulative methane yield (109.4 mL CH4/g VS) were both achieved in PF-pretreated samples after the digestion process. The dominant bacterial populations in PF-pretreated CCM were affiliated with Sideroxydans, Herbinix, Clostridium, and Smithella, which played an important role in the hydrolysis and acidification of CCM. The enrichment of Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium and highly-effective acidogenesis might account for the highest methane yield in the PF-pretreated group. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyclopentanol is a novel biofuel with high resistance to auto-ignition, which can be used as a promising additive to gasoline fuel. It is of great importance to gain a comprehensive understanding on the oxidation chemistry of cyclopentanol. The reaction of cyclopentanol with hydroxyl radical plays an important role in both combustion and atmospheric chemistry. In this study, we calculate the rate constants of cyclopentanol reaction with hydroxyl radical over a wide temperature range of 200–2500 K, using multistructural canonical variational transition state theory. The effects of variational, quantum tunneling and multistructural torsional anharmonicity were analyzed. The results show that the variational and multistructural torsional anharmonicity effects play a key role, while the quantum tunneling effect is nearly negligible for the studied reaction system. Moreover, the rate constants of reactions with submerged forward barrier heights show a non-monotonic behavior, while a positive temperature dependence is found for the rate constants of reactions with positive forward barrier heights. Our calculated total rate constants are in good agreement with those estimated in the literature (Cai et al., CNF, 2019), however, significant discrepancies are observed in the branching ratios of reaction channels. The rate constants reported in this study are expected to be more accurate and will benefit the understanding on the oxidation chemistry of cyclopentanol. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A heterogeneous CaO/Ag nano catalyst was developed and applied for biodiesel production from transesterification of soybean oil. The silver performed synergistic effects with CaO on promoting biodiesel production. The CaO/Ag nano catalysts exhibited abundant strong basic sites with larger BET surface area (7.02 vs 2.05 m2/g), pore diameter (58.84 vs 37.08 nm) and pore volume (0.070 vs 0.016 cm3/g), which significantly reduced mass transfer resistance of triglycerides during transesterification and improved the mass transfer constants. Response surface methodology was applied to investigate the influence reaction parameters and optimize biodiesel yield. A maximized biodiesel yield of 90.95 ± 2.56 % was achieved using methanol:oil molar ratio of 13, CaO/Ag loading of 5%, reaction time of 90 min and reaction temperature of 72℃. The optimized biodiesel yield for CaO catalyzed transesterification was 88.40 ± 3.34 %, using similar reaction conditions but with 180 min of reaction time. Both nano catalysts were consecutively reused for five times. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of CaO and CaO/Ag catalyzed transesterification were performed and compared. Economic evaluation of biodiesel production using CaO and CaO/Ag was performed and compared to provide insights for heterogeneous catalyst application for biodiesel production on industrial scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Oil and grease (O&G) in wastewater can be considered as two parts or proportion contained in emulsion which exceeded O&G standard. Most of oil becomes emulsified with water when they pass through grease trap and discharged in the effluents. Thus, it may indicate that either treatment of grease traps or standards for O&G content stipulated in technical memorandum of Water Pollution Control Ordinance (WPCO) do not reflect the actual situation. Existing grease traps should be upgraded to meet the requirements of WPCO. Alternative technologies need to be developed to tackle this unsolved problem. Good management and practices are also important to ensure proper collection and waste recycling rather than just disposing effluent into drains. Collected O&G content can be recycled as valuable products such as biofuel, flotation agent, or other derivatives. This approach not only protects the environment by improving water quality, it also encourages large flow restaurant operators to recycle oil and grease content towards cleaner production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Homogeneous Fenton reaction using Fe2+/H2O2 represents a green conventional alternative for lignocellulose pretreatment, but some disadvantages such as time-consuming, acidic pH, and forming iron-based sludge limit its application. Here we present an Iron Oxychloride (FeOCl)-based heterogeneous Fenton method to pretreat corn stover (CS, an abundant agriculture waste), which can be a promising approach to overcome the limitation of Fe2+/H2O2-based homogeneous Fenton pretreatment (FP). The reducing sugars yield of CS treated by this approach for 6 h was about 3 times higher than that of untreated CS and also that of CS treated by FP for 72 h. Compared with the need of low pH by FP, the pH required for FeOCl-based heterogeneous Fenton pretreatment (HFP) can be extended to the range of neutral yet maintaining similar pretreatment output. In addition, the FeOCl catalyst can be easily recovered, and its catalytic activity remains 90% even after repeated use for five times, thus reducing the production of iron-based sludge as a by-product in the pretreatment process. Our results shed light on developing a mild, clean, and low-cost pretreatment strategy for efficient lignocellulose biorefinery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As a major component of plant secondary cell walls, lignin provides structural integrity and rigidity, and contributes to primary defense by providing a physical barrier to pathogen ingress. Genetic modification of lignin biosynthesis has been adopted to reduce the recalcitrance of lignified cell walls to improve biofuel production, tree pulping properties and forage digestibility. However, lignin-modification is often, but unpredictably, associated with dwarf phenotypes. Hypotheses suggested to explain this include: collapsed vessels leading to defects in water and solute transport; accumulation of molecule(s) that are inhibitory to plant growth or deficiency of metabolites that are critical for plant growth; activation of defense pathways linked to cell wall integrity sensing. However, there is still no commonly accepted underlying mechanism for the growth defects. Here, we discuss recent data on transcriptional reprogramming in plants with modified lignin content and their corresponding suppressor mutants, and evaluate growth-defense trade-offs as a factor underlying the growth phenotypes. New approaches will be necessary to estimate how gross changes in transcriptional reprogramming may quantitatively affect growth. Better understanding of the basis for yield drag following cell wall engineering is important for the biotechnological exploitation of plants as factories for fuels and chemicals. © 2021 The Authors New Phytologist © 2021 New Phytologist Foundation

AB  - In this study, the development of an environmentally friendly version of hydrogen peroxide – acetic acid (HPAC) pretreatment was investigated and optimized with two different approaches as maximum biofuel production optimization and cost optimization. Central composite design and response surface method were used for the experimental design and data analysis, respectively. In the experimental design, investigated HPAC pretreatment parameters were 50–100 °C reaction temperature, 6–24 h reaction time, 0–2 wt% HAc and 0–2 wt% H2O2. Significant ethanol production enhancement was observed only for the samples pretreated at 100 °C. This increase was due to the enhanced enzyme accessibility by the surface area increment and delignification, which were also revealed in SEM imaging and FTIR analysis. Maximum ethanol production was observed in 2% H2O2, 0% HAc, 24 h, and 100 °C pretreatment conditions as 81.65 mg EtOH/g total solid (TS) (103.49 L EtOH/tonne TS), corresponding 49.55% of the theoretical ethanol yield. Maximum methane production, on the other hand, was observed in 2% HAc, 0% H2O2, 100 °C, 6 h conditions as 363.82 mL CH4/g VS. In terms of net energy production, cost optimum pretreatment (1.87% HAc, 0% H2O2, 50 °C, and 6 h) was found be the most beneficial condition with 67.5% energy recovery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Depleting fossil fuels target plant weeds which have the potential to be converted into efficient biofuels. In this study, mimosa seeds were utilized as a substrate for bioethanol production. This investigation was divided into three parts: breaking dormancy of seeds, mimosa seeds germination, and bioethanol production from mimosa seeds. Seed dormancy breaking was initiated by seeds soaked in hot distilled water to analyze the sugar quantity. Sugar content was measured relevance with root length results. According to results, root length obtained revealed that at 0.5–1.0 cm for root size has the most sugar availability. It was revealed that the total sugar 548.21 g/L and reducing sugar has a concentration of 248.67 g/L. Therefore, the broken dormancy of seeds using hot water at 95 °C for 10 min with a root length of 0.5–1 cm was used for ethanol fermentation. Ethanol fermentation was done by free yeast cell and immobilized yeast by injecting yeast directly. The ethanol yield was measured on the 3rd day of every fermentation. Results showed that the free cell yeast during the 1st day of fermentation afforded an ethanol production of 57.574 g/L, while the yield for immobilized yeast was 60.714 g/L. Consequently, the ethanol yield on the 2nd day of fermentation from the directly injected immobilized yeast was 60.088 g/L. Results revealed that the immobilization of yeast cells in fermentation provided a higher probability for bioethanol yield and could be utilized as a baseline for future bioethanol production. Stimulation of natural enzymes by germination of seeds for enhanced bioethanol production will be a novel approach towards next-generation biofuels. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - Cactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) is a high productivity species within the Cactaceae grown in many semiarid parts of the world for food, fodder, forage, and biofuels. O. ficus-indica utilises obligate crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), an adaptation that greatly improves water-use efficiency (WUE) and reduces crop water usage. To better understand CAM-related metabolites and water-deficit stress responses of O. ficus-indica, comparative metabolic profiling was performed on mesophyll and epidermal tissues collected from well-watered and water-deficit stressed cladodes at 50% relative water content (RWC). Tissues were collected over a 24-h period to identify metabolite levels throughout the diel cycle and analysed using a combination of acidic/basic ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) platforms. A total of 382 metabolites, including 210 (55%) named and 172 (45%) unnamed compounds, were characterised across both tissues. Most tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis intermediates were depleted in plants undergoing water-deficit stress indicative of CAM idling or post-idling, while the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO) accumulated in both mesophyll and epidermal tissues as osmoprotectants. Levels of reduced glutathione and other metabolites of the ascorbate cycle as well as oxylipins, stress hormones such as traumatic acid, and nucleotide degradation products were increased under water-deficit stress conditions. Notably, tryptophan accumulation, an atypical response, was significantly (24-fold) higher during all time points in water-deficit stressed mesophyll tissue compared with well-watered controls. Many of the metabolite increases were indicative of a highly oxidising environment under water-deficit stress. A total of 34 unnamed metabolites also accumulated in response to water-deficit stress indicating that such compounds might play important roles in water-deficit stress tolerance. © 2021 CSIRO.

AB  - In this study the techno-economic performances of three possible technologies have been assessed to identify the better one. The studied technologies include: Glycerol enriched CaO catalyzed, Supercritical ethanol, and Solid acid catalyzed processes. The overall study is based on complete process simulations using two commercially known software – Aspen Plus and Super Pro. The complete process layout for each option has been designed based on reasonable assumptions and optimum reaction conditions taken from relevant literatures. The amount and quality of biodiesel and glycerol as well as the amount of biodiesel per amount of feedstock used have been used to assess the relative technical performances among the process alternatives. For economic performance evaluation, the total cost of investment, unit cost of production, internal rate of return, net present value and project payback time have been used. The economic feasibility of each process towards change in production capacity has also been assessed. In addition, the sensitivity of each process scenario for the possible global market fluctuations of inputs and outputs has been evaluated. The glycerol enriched CaO catalyzed option is found to be the most economically feasible option under the given market scenario. All the three options are proved to be good in their technical performances, even though the solid acid catalyzed, and supercritical options are not economically efficient. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - A novel strategy involving sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) (SDS assisted tris (2-hydroxyethyl) methyl- ammonium methyl sulphate ([TMA][MeSO4], ionic liquid) pretreatment of Saccharum spontaneum biomass (SSB) following its enzymatic saccharification, and conversion into ethanol-biofuel in a consolidated bioprocess (CBP) was developed. Ionic liquid stable enzyme preparation developed from Bacillus subtilis G2 was used for saccharification. Optimized pretreatment and saccharification variables enhanced the sugar yield (2.35-fold), which was fermented to ethanol content of 104.42 mg/g biomass with an efficiency of 35.73%. The pretreated biomass was examined for textural/ultrastructural alterations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 1H/13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area measurements, water retention value, and cellulase adsorption isotherms. The combined [TMA][MeSO4] and SDS pretreatment disrupted the lignocellulosic microfibrils, and increased the porosity and surface area. The study provides new mechanistic insights on combined IL and surfactant pretreatment of biomass for its efficient conversion to biofuel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wastewater with rich nutrients has been considered as a promising resource to replace artificial culture media in the production of low-cost microalgae biofuels. However, to compete with the traditional fossil energy, the corresponding algal lipid productivity needs to be improved. In this study, iron and acetate supplements were used to improve the lipid productivity of Chlorella pyrenoidosa in actual municipal wastewater (MW). The results showed that, simultaneously adding proper amounts of iron and acetate remarkably increased the microalga dry cell weight (DCW), lipid content and lipid productivity, respectively by 185%, 248% and 671%. Moreover, the addition of acetate increased the saturation degree of the alga based fatty acid methyl esters (P < 0.05), thus improved the quality of the algal lipid with better oxidative stability. Besides, the algal phosphorus utilization efficiency (PUE) was also greatly enhanced by the acetate supplement (P < 0.05), with the conversion efficiencies of phosphorus to algal DCW and lipid in mixotrophic cultures being more than twice of those in the corresponding phototrophic cultures. Finally, a bio-formation of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) by the microalga was reported, indicating potential phosphorus recovery by microalgae-driven bio-production of phosphorus-containing products combined with phosphorus removal in wastewaters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyanobacteria can be utilized as a platform for direct phototrophic conversion of CO2 to produce several types of carbon-neutral biofuels. One promising compound to be produced photobiologically in cyanobacteria is isobutene. As a volatile compound, isobutene will quickly escape the cells without building up to toxic levels in growth medium or get caught in the membranes. Unlike liquid biofuels, gaseous isobutene may be collected from the headspace and thus avoid the costly extraction of a chemical from culture medium or from cells. Here we investigate a putative synthetic pathway for isobutene production suitable for a photoautotrophic host. First, we expressed α-ketoisocaproate dioxygenase from Rattus norvegicus (RnKICD) in Escherichia coli. We discovered isobutene formation with the purified RnKICD with the rate of 104.6 ​± ​9 ​ng (mg protein)-1 min-1 using α-ketoisocaproate as a substrate. We further demonstrate isobutene production in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by introducing the RnKICD enzyme. Synechocystis strain heterologously expressing the RnKICD produced 91 ​ng ​l−1 OD750−1 ​h−1. Thus, we demonstrate a novel sustainable platform for cyanobacterial production of an important building block chemical, isobutene. These results indicate that RnKICD can be used to further optimize the synthetic isobutene pathway by protein and metabolic engineering efforts. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Cyanobacteria are one of the most promising microorganisms to produce biofuels and renewable chemicals due to their oxygenic autotrophic growth properties. However, to rely on photosynthesis, which is one of the main reasons for slow growth, low carbon assimlation rate and low production, is a bottleneck. To address this challenge, optimizing the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle is one of the strategies since it is the main carbon fixation pathway. In a previous study, we showed that overexpression of either aldolase (FBA), transketolase (TK), or fructose-1,6/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (FBP/SBPase), enzymes responsible for RuBP regeneration and vital for controlling the CBB carbon flux, led to higher production rates and titers in ethanol producing strains of Synechocystis PCC 6803. In the present study, we investigated the combined effects of the above enzymes on ethanol production in Synechocystis PCC 6803. The ethanol production of the strains overexpressing two CBB enzymes (FBA ​+ ​TK, FBP/SBPase ​+ ​FBA or FBP/SBPase ​+ ​TK) was higher than the respective control strains, overexpressing either FBA or TK. The co-overexpression of FBA and TK led to more than 9 times higher ethanol production compared to the overexpression of FBA. Compared to TK the respective increase is 4 times more ethanol production. Overexpression of FBP/SBPase in combination with FBA showed 2.5 times higher ethanol production compared to FBA. Finally, co-overexpression of FBP/SBPase and TK reached about twice the production of ethanol compared to overexpression of only TK. This study clearly demonstrates that overexpression of two selected CBB enzymes leads to significantly increased ethanol production compared to overexpression of a single CBB enzyme. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Bio-based isobutanol has attracted more and more attention due to its wide application and excellent fuel performance. Compared with ethanol, isobutanol has higher energy density, lower oxygen content, and hygroscopicity, making it an ideal gasoline additive or substitute. Bio-based isobutanol has been commercially produced from a variety of renewable feedstock, including corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, and sugar cane by using a yeast biocatalyst. The existing facility of ethanol plants is acquired to separate and purify isobutanol from the fermentation broth, meaning that the energy-intensive distillation process still cannot be replaced. There are still some challenges in the production of bio-based isobutanol, such as low product concentration, unexpected impurities, high separation cost, thus the development of an efficient and low-cost downstream separation process has become one of the keys to the industrial production of bio-based isobutanol. The separation methods for isobutanol recovery, including vacuum evaporation, adsorption, pervaporation, gas stripping, solvent extraction, salting-out, salting-out extraction, are summarized in this review. An outlook on the challenges and opportunities of isobutanol separation is also described in this review. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Biomethane constitutes an important biofuel for the transition towards a biobased circular economy with a sustainable energy sector. An environmentally friendly pathway for its production is through the gasification of 2nd generation biomass that generates syngas (H2, CO, and CO2), followed by syngas biomethanation. A novel design thermophilic trickle bed bioreactor was successfully tested at semi-pilot scale. It was operated continuously performing biomethanation of an artificial syngas mixture (45% H2, 20% CO, 25% CO2 and 10% N2). Its effectiveness was compared to a primitive design lab scale trickle bed reactor with a 28 times lower bed volume under identical operating conditions. At an empty bed residence time of 0.6 h, the novel semi-pilot scale trickle bed reactor converted 100% and 98% of the influent H2 and CO, respectively and produced CH4 at a rate of 10.6 ± 0.2 mmol·lbed−1·h−1, whereas the lab scale reactor converted 89% of the H2 and 73% of the CO and achieved a CH4 productivity of 8.5 mmol·lbed−1·h−1. The maximum CH4 productivity achieved in the semi-pilot scale reactor was 17.6 ± 0.6 mmol·lbed−1·h−1 at an empty bed residence time of 0.33 h with a 99.2 ± 0.1% product selectivity. Furthermore, the semi-pilot scale reactor was connected in series with a fluidized bed gasifier fed with wood pellets to assess the biomethanation potential of the system when supplied with real syngas. The obtained results showed no process inhibition in the semi-pilot scale reactor, which accomplished 100% H2 conversion efficiency and 92.4 ± 0.6% CO conversion efficiency at an empty bed residence time of 0.6 h. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae based biofuel is dictated to a great extent by certain synergistic interactions between critical nutrients as well as the quality and quantity of light energy available. For latitude regions with high light irradiance for a greater part of year, it is important to optimize the proportions of critical nutrients for microalgae species to display a suitable metabolic profile and not loose advantage when total light energy input increases. In this study, the conjunct impact of light intensity using white LED, together with photoperiod and nutrients (nitrate, phosphate and glucose) depleted and replete conditions on energy storage metabolites and fuel characteristics of Scenedesmus sp. were investigated under a mixotrophic growth regime. Results show that Scenedesmus sp. could efficiently exploit even very intense light, for longer duration (216 μmolm−2s−1 at 16:8 light: dark photoperiod) in presence of 1.5 g/L of sodium nitrate, 0.04 g/L of di-sodium hydrogen phosphate and 5 g/L of glucose (G5N1.5P0.04) to produce a biomass of 1782.4 ± 56.8 μg/mL with a specific growth rate of 0.2 ± 0.007 day−1. High light intensity (216 μmolm−2s−1) and organic carbon at 16:8 light: dark photoperiod (L16:D8) led to increased synthesis of carbohydrate content in the absence of nitrate and phosphate (1924.8 ± 128.6 μg/mg at G5N0P0), increased TFA in the absence of nitrate (59.5 μg/mg at G5N0P0.04) and high lipid content (154.1 ± 7.7 μg/mg at G5N1.5P0.04) without obliterating growth. Certain vital properties that determine the biodiesel quality were computed and compared to the parallel parameters put forth by European and American biodiesel norms. These results stand to be a baseline for sustainable algal bio-refinery and create futuristic vistas for further evaluation of Scenedesmus sp. for bio-energy applications in countries like India having tropical climate with high solar incoming radiation for a greater part of the year. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermochemical pretreatment is one of the key steps to process lignocellulosic biomass for production of biofuels and biomaterials. γ-valerolactone (GVL) has been used as a green and renewable solvent to efficiently dissolve lignin under acidic conditions and enhance subsequent enzyme digestibility. Further improvement is still required to lower the pretreatment temperature in order to reduce sugar degradation and irreversible lignin condensation, as well as the capital cost. In this study, we compared the use of HCl and H2SO4 as catalysts during GVL pretreatment, and found the performance of GVL-HCl at 100 °C was comparable to that of GVL-H2SO4 at 120 °C in terms of xylan and lignin removal and enzyme digestibility. We further monitored the lignin removal and cellulose accessibility in the cell walls at different pretreatment time points by imaging the changes in lignin auto-fluorescence and in CtCBM3-GFP binding with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), respectively. We found GVL-HCl pretreatment at a relative low temperature (100 °C) could rapidly remove lignin in the compound middle lamella and cell corner areas, which concurred with the increase of CtCBM3-GFP binding in these areas. Real-time imaging of cell wall degradation by cellulases further revealed that the secondary cell walls could be digested from both cell lumen and CML sides, and eventually fully deconstructed within 24 h. Our results provide new insight into the effects of chloride anions on plant cell wall structure during GVL pretreatment, and offer potential routes to further optimize and enhance the efficiency of GVL-based pretreatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) have great application prospects by catalyzing the redox reaction of biofuels to generate electricity. In order to further improve the output performance of EBFCs, the influences of electrode shape and array on the outputs of EBFCs were investigated by finite element analysis. The relationship between electrode shapes and the distribution of field strength and voltage were firstly explored by graphical method. According to simulation results, circular electrodes distribution would be the best choice for EBFCs with a maximum power density (MPD) of over 4.7 mW cm−2 and the least current density range of 4.4 mA cm−2 under ideal conditions. The hexagonal close-packed array was able to distribute more electrodes and thus obtain higher total power outputs. For the monopolar plate EBFCs, anodes and cathodes were interlaced on the same plate to facilitate the application of wearable and implantable devices. Moreover, the network topology theory was applied to the design of electrode array in EBFCs, which provided extensive electrode array structures for EBFCs. The results exhibited that the MPD of radial and star topologies were both about 4.7 mW cm−2, while that of ring topology was much smaller. The electrode shape and electrode array studied in this paper would be of great significance to the structural design of EBFCs devices. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - This research aims to study the effect of phenol on growth, metabolism, antioxidant activity and its bioremoval by Scenedesmus abundans. High phenol concentrations reduced the chlorophyll and dry weight of S. abundans. As phenol concentration increased, the total lipid, protein and amino acid content increased. The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, total antioxidant capacity and catalase enzyme were generally enhanced by phenol concentrations. The biosorption ability of dried S abundans biomass for the phenol removal from the aqueous solution was also examined as a function of pH, biosorbent dosage, contact time and initial phenol concentrations. The optimum biosorption was achieved at pH 6, 0.5 g/100 ml algal dose, 90 min contact time and 100 mg/L phenol concentration. The biosorption models of Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin–Radushkevich and Temkin were well applied, providing the experimental data with the best fit. The maximum biosorption capacity was 57.8 mg/g at the optimum conditions. The kinetic biosorption was also well described by the pseudo-first order, with film and intra-particle controlled the biosorption mechanism. The thermodynamic parameters revealed that the process of biosorption was feasible, spontaneous and endothermic. The ΔG0 values indicate that physisorption is the process of phenol biosorption on S. abundans. Additionally, by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction analysis, the biosorbent characterization was assessed. Therefore, S. abundans could be used as a promising biosorbent for removal of phenol and other organic contaminants. The removal capability of phenol by S. abundans can also encourage the use of the wasted biomass as a feedstock for biofuel production giving it a green environmentally sustainable operation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the ethanol production by Wickerhamomyces sp. using soybean straw and hull hydrolysates obtained by subcritical water hydrolysis and, afterward, the biogas production using the fermented hydrolysates. Ethanol was produced using the straw and hull hydrolysates diluted and supplement with glucose, reaching 5.57 ± 0.01 g/L and 6.11 ± 0.11 g/L, respectively. The fermentation in a bioreactor with changing the pH to 7.0 allowed achieving maximum ethanol production of 4.03 and 3.60 g/L for straw and hull hydrolysates at 24 h, respectively. The biogas productions obtained for the fermented hydrolysates of straw with and without changing the pH were 739 ± 37 and 652 ± 34 NmL/gVSad, respectively. The fermented hydrolysate of hull without changing the pH presented 620 ± 26 NmL/gVSad. The soybean residues produced biofuels, indicating these residues show potential as raw material for renewable energy production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two different technological process configurations for producing bioethanol from corn stover, namely, enzymatic hydrolysis for sugar production followed by fermentation (P1) and nonenzymatic chemical hydrolysis and subsequent fermentation (P2), were analyzed by a rigorous life cycle assessment. Three environmental impact categories (climate change (CC), fossil depletion (FD), and air pollutant (AP)) were estimated for the both process configurations on a system level. The “best-practice” case with a real scenario of the United States of America indicates that P2 is the most promising strategy from the perspectives of CC, FD, and AP. Considerable savings were achieved by P2: 1.34 kg CO2-eq/gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) for CC, 0.12 MJ/GGE for FD, and 0.24–0.94 g particle matters/GGE for AP. The robustness of the environmental impact results was validated by a scenario uncertainty analysis, and its results indicated that the corn stover composition is crucial. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Walnut shell pyrolysis liquefaction experiments for phenolic enrichment were conducted using torrefaction pretreatment and fractional condensation simultaneously. Bio-oil composition was comprehensively analyzed for elements, functional groups and componential contents. After high-temperature torrefaction, the proportion of lignin pyrolytic products in pyrolysis organic vapors showed significant increment. Fractional condensation further separated water, acetic acid and other small molecular compounds, and improved the phenolic content in the target bio-oil. Compared with the traditional pyrolysis liquefaction technology, when 363 K water bath was utilized to recover 300 °C torrefied walnut shell pyrolysis vapors, the C/O ratio in bio-oil increased from 0.5 to 1.6, and the proportions of H in aromatic ring and phenolic OH increased by 150% and 400%, respectively. The total content of detectable phenols was enriched from 2.7 wt% to 13.3 wt%. The optimized scheme on improving economic efficiency was provided for offsetting torrefaction energy consumption and low bio-oil yield. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Swine manure and corn stover are abundant agricultural wastes which contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, nutrient runoff leading to eutrophication, and a biosafety risk with respect to improper swine manure handling. Anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of swine manure and corn stover can mitigate these negative impacts while producing biogas as a renewable energy source. Semi-continuous mesophilic plug flow reactor (PFR operation) was studied during a step-wise increase in organic loading rate (OLR) over the range of 0.25–4.7 kg volatile solids added (VS) m−3 d−1, which corresponded to total solids content (TS) of 1.5–9.0%. Process stability was observed at all OLR, with the highest total biogas yield and methane content of 0.674 ± 0.06 m−3 kg−1 and 62%, respectively, at 0.25 kg m−3 d−1. As OLR and TS increased, VS reduction decreased and volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased due to shorter hydraulic retention times (HRT). Hygienization potential was assayed using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), with some groups being reduced (E. coli, fecal coliforms) and others not (Clostridia spp., fecal enterococci). Lignocellulolytic enzyme activity trended upward as OLR was increased, highlighting changes in microbial activity in response to feeding rate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Porous carbon electrodes have considerably improved the performance of biofuel cells and biosensors in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel in-situ analysis method for porous enzyme electrodes. By combining three-dimensional (3D) impedance measurement and a double-channel transmission line model, the stability of porous enzyme electrodes during operation can be evaluated. The proposed method can distinguish between the functional stability of the enzyme and mediator reaction and the general structural stability of the electrode. We demonstrated this method by evaluating bilirubin oxidase-modified carbon cloth (CC) electrodes with and without a magnesium oxide (MgO)-templated carbon coating. In case of the CC electrode, a remarkable increase in the charge transfer resistance within the first 500 s indicated the elution of the enzyme and mediator. When the CC was coated with MgO-templated carbon before enzyme modification, the charge transfer resistance remained constant, indicating an effective suppression of the elution of the enzyme and mediator. The electric double-layer capacitance values of both electrodes indicated that their general electrode structures were stable during the analysis. Thus, the proposed analytical method, based on 3D impedance, can be a powerful tool for simultaneously detecting possible changes in the general electrode structure of enzyme electrodes and in the amount of active enzymes and mediators on the electrode surface. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The integration of gasification with syngas fermentation is still in an early stage of development, where many questions exist concerning the syngas quality required. The challenge is to define the gasification conditions that will provide a H2:CO:CO2 ratio suitable for syngas fermentation, as well as to identify and remove the compounds that can inhibit the performance of the microorganisms. The right balance between the gasification conditions and a line up with minimal gas cleaning needs to be assessed to improve the economic feasibility of the process. In this work a first attempt to combine the two processes is presented, with the aim to provide an insight of the indirect gasification, the gas cleaning applied, the effect of the main impurities and the performance of syngas fermentation. A lignin rich feedstock was gasified with steam in an indirect gasifier, at TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research). The gas, after removal of some components that could hinder the performance of the fermentation (tar compounds, BTX, unsaturated hydrocarbons and sulphur compounds), consisted of CO, H2, CO2, CH4, C2H6 and traces of other hydrocarbons. The influence of the obtained syngas quality and composition was evaluated in the fermentation process using Clostridium ljungdahlii, at KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). For comparison, product gas from beech wood gasification was also evaluated in the fermentation process under the same conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulose hydrolysis is an extensively studied process due to its relevance in the fields of biofuels, chemicals production, and renewable nanomaterials. However, the direct visualization of the process accompanied with detailed scaling has not been reported because of the vast morphological alterations occurring in cellulosic fibers in typical heterogeneous (solid/liquid) hydrolytic systems. Here, we overcome this distraction by exposing hardwood cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) deposited on silica substrates to pressurized HCl gas in a solid/gas system and examine the changes in individual CNFs by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results revealed that hydrolysis proceeds via an intermediate semi-fibrous stage before objects reminiscent of cellulose nanocrystals were formed. The length of the nanocrystal-like objects correlated well with molar mass, as analyzed by gel permeation chromatography, performed on CNF aerogels hydrolyzed under identical conditions. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction showed a slight increase in crystallinity index as the hydrolysis proceeded. The results provide a modern visual complement to >100 years of research in cellulose degradation. ©

AB  - Volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which can be generated by acidogenesis of organic wastes, are important building blocks for chemicals production, and are intermediates in many bioprocesses such as microbial lipids production. Important factors affecting the bioconversion of VFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) by Yarrowia lipolytica W29 and NCYC 2904 for growth and lipids accumulation were studied. Yarrowia lipolytica grew efficiently in VFAs-based media, but lipids production was enhanced by the addition of co-substrates (glucose or glycerol) in batch cultures. A two-stage batch culture – growth phase on glucose, followed by VFAs addition, improved lipids accumulation. Lipids concentrations of 2.3 g·L−1 and 3.5 g·L−1 were obtained with this mode of operation, with addition of 18 g·L−1 VFAs, for Y. lipolytica W29 and NCYC 2904, respectively. For the first time, it was demonstrated that oxygen mass transfer is a crucial factor for lipids production by Y. lipolytica from VFAs. Intracellular lipids produced by Y. lipolytica strains were mainly composed by oleic and linoleic acids, similar to common vegetable oils, making these lipids suitable for biodiesel production. Moreover, margaric acid, which may improve biodiesel properties, was only detected in propionate medium. The strategies studied herein will contribute to the feasibility of using VFAs as low-cost feedstock for microbial lipids production by Y. lipolytica strains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of chemoselective and heterogeneous earth-abundant metal catalysts is essential for environmentally friendly chemical synthesis. We report a highly efficient, chemoselective, and reusable single-site nickel(II) hydride catalyst based on robust and porous aluminum metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (DUT-5) for hydrogenation of nitro and nitrile compounds to the corresponding amines and hydrogenolysis of aryl ethers under mild conditions. The nickel-hydride catalyst was prepared by the metalation of aluminum hydroxide secondary building units (SBUs) of DUT-5 having the formula of Al(μ2-OH)(bpdc) (bpdc = 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylate) with NiBr2 followed by a reaction with NaEt3BH. DUT-5-NiH has a broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance in the hydrogenation of aromatic and aliphatic nitro and nitrile compounds under 1 bar H2 and could be recycled and reused at least 10 times. By changing the reaction conditions of the hydrogenation of nitriles, symmetric or unsymmetric secondary amines were also afforded selectively. The experimental and computational studies suggested reversible nitrile coordination to nickel followed by 1,2-insertion of coordinated nitrile into the nickel-hydride bond occurring in the turnover-limiting step. In addition, DUT-5-NiH is also an active catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenolysis of carbon-oxygen bonds in aryl ethers to afford hydrocarbons under atmospheric hydrogen in the absence of any base, which is important for the generation of fuels from biomass. This work highlights the potential of MOF-based single-site earth-abundant metal catalysts for practical and eco-friendly production of chemical feedstocks and biofuels. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Crop straws provide enormous lignocellulose residues convertible to biofuels, whereas Arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) pollute agricultural soil and water source. Hence, it becomes important to explore a compelling biomass process technology for both bioethanol production and trace metal remediation. In this study, we selected classic rice cultivars that distinctively accumulated As from 10.25 to 16.18 μg/g in their mature straws from the As-polluted farming soils, being up to 10-fold higher than those of the previously-reported rice straws and other crops. By performing various chemical pretreatments with the As-accumulated rice straws, this study sorted out that the optimal two-step 2%H2SO4 and 2%NaOH pretreatments could cause almost complete biomass enzymatic saccharification for high bioethanol production in all rice straws examined, along with a full As release for As recycling as potential high-value crystallized chemical. Furthermore, all remaining lignin-rich solid resides were finally examined to act as active biosorbent for Pb adsorption, with the optimal Pb adsorption conditions established (1 g/L adsorbent dose at pH6.0 and room temperature). Hence, this study has not only demonstrated a cascading-like strategy for efficient As and Pb remediation in agricultural soil and water source, but it has also provided a value-added approach for complete utilization of crop straws towards high bioethanol production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of biomass pellets as a renewable energy source is increasing, leading to the need for rapid assessment of biofuel pellet quality for production monitoring. The purpose of this work was to use line-scan near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral image technology coupled with chemometric tools to assess the elemental components of biomass pellets. The parameters influencing model performance were investigated, i.e. wavelength and spectral pretreatment technique. Either full wavelength or partial wavelength selected using interval successive projections algorithm (iSPA) and interval genetic algorithm (iGA) were investigated. Either raw spectra or pretreated spectra were used for model development. The models were developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The most effective model for the prediction of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N) content was developed using iGA wavelength selection and standard normal variate (SNV) spectral pretreatment and provided the highest accuracy with a coefficient of determination of prediction set (r2p) and standard error of prediction (SEP) of 0.83 and 1.33%; 0.84 and 0.17%; and 0.90 and 0.098%, respectively. The model could be used for quality assurance. The S content model was poor and not recommended. The relationship between pellet chemical parameters and reflectance characteristics could be used for predicting C, H, and N of biomass pellets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the context of biofuel production and achieving sustainable bioeconomy, the use of lignocellulosic and algae biomass in anaerobic fermentation processes yields biohythane that has a typical composition of 10–15% H2, 50–55% CH4 and 30–40% CO2. Using organic biomass-based substrates has been shown to minimize environmental impacts due to the versatile production of high-value products under normal operating conditions that are practically achievable. However, the biohythane yield depends on different factors such as the biomass type, the organic loading rate, soluble metabolic products formed, the type of fermentation (single/dual stage) and the pretreatment strategy adopted for the biomass. Different pretreatment strategies based on physical, chemical and biological processes have been proposed in the literature. In this review, improvements in biohythane yield as a result of these pretreatment strategies, the need/effect of inoculum enrichment, the effects of pH, temperature, trace element addition and organic loading rate has been reviewed. Finally, the major developments of improving biohythane yield due to the addition of co-substrates and the current trends are discussed. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Given the scarceness of fossil fuels and high volume of pollution caused through the consumption of these fuels, many efforts are being made to produce alternative fuels. Biodiesel is one of the alternatives to diesel fuels. The main problem with biodiesel production is higher operation costs, as compared with diesel fuels. In this study, waste cooking oil and cow bone as the catalyst were used to reduce feed costs as much as possible. Moreover, a microreactor was utilized to reduce the residence time to 1 min. Using Box-Behnken design method, the effect of different variables including catalyst concentration (calcined cow bone), oil to methanol volume ratio, residence time, and reaction temperature on the purity of produced biodiesel were examined. The results showed that when using a catalyst concentration of 8.5 wt %, an oil to methanol volume ratio of 2.25 vol: vol, a residence time of 60 s, and a temperature of 63.1 °C, the maximum purity of biodiesel was 99.24%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An environment friendly and cost-effective approach is a major bottleneck in biofuels production from agriculture waste residue. The present study unravels the enzymatic hydrolytic potential of a designed bacterial consortium (SNH-1) comprised of camel rumen derived B. safensis CRN 13, B. subtilis CRN 16, C. braakii CRN 21, B. circulans CRN 24, and P. dendritiformis CRN18. The consortium SNH-1 was evaluated for exo-glucanase (0.29 U/ml), β-glucosidase (0.69U/ml), β-glucuronidase (0.29U/ml), endoxylanase (0.79U/ml), arabinosidase (0.62U/ml), α-galactosidase (0.36 U/ml), and endoglucanase (0.51U/ml) activity. Genome analysis of consortium members identified 660 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) responsible for breaking the structural intricacy. These include 296 glycoside hydrolase, 19 auxiliary activity, 186 glycosyl transferases, and 37 carbohydrate-binding modules genes. The designed consortium hydrolyzed sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw, and rice straw effectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the pH, temperature, and substrate concentration, which has resulted in a 23% higher saccharification of wheat straw. Further, 6.2% bioethanol production was estimated from wheat straw hydrolysate using S. cerevisiae. The wheat straw saccharification by the designed consortium is a cost-effective, chemical-free, cleaner, and promising approach for producing lignocellulosic bioethanol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel is an eco-friendly alternative source for the depleting fossil fuel resources. The catalytic conversion of biomass into biofuel is an emerging technique in biofuel production. In this study, iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized from Spinacia oleracea by green synthesis method and subsequently sulfonated to produce active nanocatalyst material. The catalyst obtained has high acid activity and can be readily recovered by an external magnetic field. Corncob waste was crushed to powder form and is subjected to pretreatment by ultrasonication. The compositional analysis was carried out using the Soxhlet extraction method to estimate the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents. The functional group of biomass and morphology changes were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The active nanocatalyst was tested for the hydrolysis of corncob into sugar. The effects of catalyst dosage and temperature on sugar yield were studied. The reducing sugar yield was measured using the dinitrosalicylic acid test. The production of bioethanol from sugar hydrolysate was carried out using a simultaneous saccharification route. A reference sample and the sample with a high yield of reducing sugar were taken into the fermentation process, which was done using Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast; this yeast was initially cultured in the YPD medium, and the grown yeast was used in the fermentation process for the production of bioethanol, whose yield was confirmed using GC analysis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Exploiting electrocatalysis for wearable enzyme-free biosensors and biofuel cells has recently greatly developed in preliminary medical diagnosis and human healthcare fields. Herein, several facet-controlled cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanostructures have been systematically fabricated to investigate the facet-dependent electrocatalysis mechanism. As a result, cuboctahedral Cu2O with a hollow structure exhibits optimal sensing performance for glucose detection compared with octahedral or extended hexapod Cu2O. The facet-dependent sensing process reveals that Cu2O{100} and Cu2O{111} facets are helpful in acquiring a higher interaction with enzyme-free substrates and accelerating electron transfer, respectively, to improve electrocatalytic activity. As a proof of concept, combined with a portable wireless device, wearable Cu2O enzyme-free biofuel cell systems can achieve glucose sensing by both open circuit potential and power output signals, which would potentially be used for a wearable enzyme-free energy platform. Therefore, this wearable enzyme-free smart sensing concept would help in the targeted establishment of biomarker electrocatalysts, and further offers considerable promise for the development of biofuel cells in the wearable healthcare monitoring field. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microbial fuel cell (MFC) efficiency depends on charge transfer capability from microbe to anode, and the application of suitable redox mediators is important in this area. In this study, yeast viability experiments were performed to determine the 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (mena-dione (MD)) influence on different yeast cell species (baker’s yeast and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells). In addition, electrochemical measurements to investigate MFC performance and efficiency were carried out. This research revealed that baker’s yeast cells were more resistant to dissolved MD, but the current density decreased when yeast solution concentration was incrementally in-creased in the same cell. The maximal calculated power of a designed baker’s yeast-based MFC cell anode was 0.408 mW/m2 and this power output was registered at 24 mV. Simultaneously, the cell generated a 62-mV open circuit potential in the presence of 23 mM potassium ferricyanide and the absence of glucose and immobilized MD. The results only confirm that MD has strong potential to be applied to microbial fuel cells and that a two-redox-mediator-based system is suitable for application in microbial fuel cells. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Enzymatic reactions involving glucose hold the potential for building implantable biosensors and embedded power generators for various medical applications. While Biofuel cells (BFCs) such as enzymatic glucose/O2 are ensured to benefit from abundant chemical resources that can be harvested in the immediate environment of the human body, the highly critical in vivo kinetics of biofuel cell is not yet fully understood. Unfortunately, existing solutions for real-time monitoring of the reaction on rodents are not possible today, or too bulky, which has a biasing impact on the animal behavior. This work presents a light, battery-less, and wireless strategy to continuously monitor a BFC implanted in a laboratory rat using a Frequency Identification (RFID) link. An extremely lightweight and flexible tag antenna of footprint lower than 10 cm2 is presented with communication capability above 60 cm in field environment. The operational capabilities are demonstrated with a 24-hour continuous monitoring of an enzymatic glucose/O2 reaction, both in vitro and in vivo. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Although biochar can be considered as a potential amendment to ameliorate degraded soils with many studies reported, little is known about its effects on acidic soils grown with elephant grass (Pennisetum Purpureum Schumach), a bioenergy crop. The current study aimed to (1) examine the effects of coffee husk-derived biochar on the grass's yield and properties of acidic soil and (2) identify potential mechanisms in determining the yield. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to test five treatments (no biochar – T1, 2% biochar-T2, 4% biochar-T3, 2% cow manure-T4, and a mixture of 1% biochar plus 1% cow manure –T5) in four replicates. The pots were grown with elephant grass for three successive harvests. Soil after each harvest was taken to analyze for 14 parameters, which were used for SQI estimation. Biochar significantly increased the biomass yield by 61 (T2) and 82 % (T3), compared to T1. pH, cation exchange capacity, and the concentration of Mehlich-1 P and exchangeable bases (K, Na, and Ca) were significantly enhanced, while exchangeable acidity and the concentration of exchangeable H+, Al, and Fe were significantly decreased following biochar addition. The SQI was significantly better in the biochar-added soil than the non-biochar soil. The improved biomass yield could be involved in a few mechanisms, including liming effect, co-addition of nutrients with the added biochar, and nutrient use efficiency. In brief, biochar is a potential amendment in mitigating the constraints of acidic soils, leading to the enhanced biomass yield of elephant grass in the soils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production using microbial oil derived from food waste discarded by the hospilatity sector could provide a sustainable replacement for diesel fuel. Discarded potato peels were used in solid-state fermentations of Aspergillus awamori for the production of glucoamylase (30 U/g) and protease (50 U/g). Hospitality food waste hydrolysis led to 98% (w/w) starch to glucose conversion yields. Crude hydrolyzates were used in shake flask fermentations with the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides Y-27012 leading to 32.9 g/L total dry weight (TDW) with 36.4% (w/w) intracellular lipid content. Fed-bath bioreactor cultures resulted in TDW of 53.9 g/L and lipid concentration of 26.7 g/L. Principal component analysis showed a fatty acid profile similar to soybean oil and solid food waste oil. Microbial oil was transesterified into biodiesel with satisfactory performance considering the European standard EN 14214. This work demonstrated that valorization of food waste for biodiesel production is feasible. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, we describe the development of a hybrid bioreactor with integrated chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) fixed-bed and zeolite as a microorganism nutrition carrier (MNC), aiming at enhancing and sustaining biohydrogen production during the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. In the batch test, the hybrid bioreactor achieved a maximum biohydrogen production of 646.3 mL/L. Accordingly, the hybrid bioreactor significantly enhanced biohydrogen production and maintained a stable performance for 50 days of semi-continuous operation. This result should be attributed to the CPE providing roughness surface and high porosity for microorganism immobilization, resulting in the enhancement of microbial quantity, confirmed by our scanning electron microscope and immobilized biomass analyses. Moreover, the element ratio significantly decreased, indicating that zeolite could provide metal cations for stimulating microbial bioactivity and growth, as well as contributing to superior biohydrogen productivity during the 50-day operation. In order to further enhance and sustain long-term biohydrogen production, raw zeolite was modified with iron. The hybrid-Fe bioreactor (CPE with Fe-modified zeolite) operated mainly following the acetate pathway and exhibited higher sustainability in improving biohydrogen production with a peak value of 1893.0 mL/L during a 72-day-lasting operation. The synergistic mechanism of the Fe-modified zeolite and CPE fixed-bed revealed that it could effectively induce favorable pathways and contribute to the synthesis of essential enzymes, micronutrient supplementation, electoral conductivity, and microbial immobilization for biohydrogen production. Therefore, a hybrid-Fe bioreactor could provide a unique alternative for the enhancement of hydrogen production for practical applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Self-powered glucose biosensor (SPGB) is of great interest due to the advantages including single configuration, good stability and particularly no need of external power sources. Herein, a mediator-free SPGB with high sensitivity and good selectivity is constructed based on a hybrid enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) composed of a glucose oxidase/cobalt phthalocyanine/1-pyrenebutyric acid/buckypaper (GOD/CoPc/PBA/BP) bioanode and a MnO2/PBA/BP capacitive cathode. The efficient electron transfer from GOD to electrodes is achieved successfully through the anode oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), one nature product of glucose oxidation catalyzed by GOD, thus avoiding the potential drawbacks posed by the use of redox mediators. CoPc servers as an efficient catalyst to lower the anode potential required by the reaction of H2O2 to 0.17 V. The MnO2/PBA/BP capacitive cathode is utilized because it can not only provide a high discharge potential and adequate capacitance to match the bioanode well, but also exhibit no potential interference to the anodic reaction. The concentration of glucose can be detected simply by measuring the output of the SPGB and a wide linear detection range from 0.5 to 8 mM has been obtained with high sensitivities of 48.66 and 32.12 μA·cm−2·mM−1 with and without stirring, respectively. The recoveries of glucose in grape juice and human serum are in the range from 99.5% to 101.2% with the relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 8%, indicating the good promise of the SPGB in sensing glucose in real samples.

AB  - Exploration of eco-friendly energy resources substituting conventional fossil fuels is the real challenge globally. Prospectively, current investigation accentuates the fermentative conversion of low-cost lignocellulosic biomass waste, sugarcane bagasse (SCB) into bioethanol and biohydrogen exploiting thermophilic cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum DSMZ 1313. Initially, the optimization of some key fermentation factors for bioethanol and biohydrogen productions was done in 150 ml serum bottles employing Taguchi orthogonal array L27 (3̂13) experimental design. Results elucidated that the most suitable factors for ethanologenesis were 70 g/L cellulose, 10 g/L corn-steep liquor (CSL), 15 mg/L ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·6H2O), 1 g/L magnesium chloride (MgCl2·6H2O), pH 7, and 5 days incubation whereas for hydrogen fermentation were 60 g/L cellulose, 30 g/L CSL, 5 mg/L FeSO4·6H2O, 2 g/L MgCl2·6H2O, pH 7, and 3 days incubation. Quantitatively, 7.422 g/L ethanol and 56.891/50 ml hydrogen were produced from cellulose while 6.352 g/L ethanol and 51.685/50 ml hydrogen with H2SO4-pretreated SCB (substituted with cellulose). Scaled-up suspended-cell fermentations in bench-scale stirred-tank bioreactor resulted in 11.77% increased ethanol yield (0.239 g ethanol/g of glucose) and twofold higher hydrogen volumes (106.88 ml hydrogen/g of glucose). The employment of SCB directly as substrate for biofuels production has appeared sustainable to meet the high global energy demands. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - In this paper, we present a neutral non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (GBFC) based on a Pt/Au nano-alloy anode. We synthesize Pt/Au alloy anodes by the electrochemical deposition of a Pt/Au nano-alloy on the surface of a thin polyethylene terephthalate membrane with a uniformly distributed microhemispheric array. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GBFC can generate a maximum power density of 0.32 mW/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.42 V, and a short-circuit current (Isc) density of 2.67 mA/cm2 with 5 mM of glucose in a 0.1-M PBS (pH 7.4) solution while the cathode is being supplied with 7% saturated oxygen. The synergistic effect of the Pt/Au bimetallic alloy is found to improve the performance of the proposed GBFC. The proposed neutral non-enzymatic GBFC shows promising feasibility as an implantable power supply system for the provision of continuous and consistent electricity to a continuous glucose monitoring system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite high pollution risk, the termination of mining practices is not in question in the current era in line with the growing needs of beings. Instead, the rehabilitation by phytoremediation restores the economic and aesthetic values of the damaged locale. Here, potentially toxic elements (PTEs) tolerant 29 Trichoderma isolates from mining sites located foothills of Turkey`s NE Black Sea coast were isolated. The highest tolerant strain (As 1400 mg L−1, Cd 1200 mg L−1, Cu 2000 mg L−1, Pb 2100 mg L−1, Zn 3000 mg L−1) was characterized with tef-1α barcode and deposited in the GenBank. The PTEs removal strength of novel Trichoderma harzianum TS143 was highest for Pb (58%) and the lowest for As (8.5%) in the order of Pb &gt; Cd &gt; Cu &gt; Zn &gt; As. While bioleaching capacity was highest in Cd with 30%, the lowest was for As (8%). TS143 was found remarkably effective on all the physicochemical parameters in the shoot and root tissues of maize. The increase in the carbohydrate content (33%) proves the potential usage of the contaminated maize plants in bioenergy production. Core sustainable agents with their mesh type robust hyphal structure enfolding PTEs such as TS143 contribute to the phytoremediation technology along with potential plant biomass management for the biodiesel industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Miscanthus sacchariflorus is a potential source of sustainable biofuel and other bioactive compounds. The high adaptive range of M. sacchariflorus may cause variation in its morphological traits and phytochemical composition. Although some metabolites have been reported from M. sac-chariflorus, little is known about its phenolic compound composition and antioxidant or oxidant properties. This study evaluated the morphological traits, antioxidant properties, and phenolic compound profile of M. sacchariflorus collected from various regions of China, Korea, Japan, and Russia. The antioxidant potential of the leaf extracts of various accessions of M. sacchariflorus was estimated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and 2,2′-azinobis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate (ABTS). An extensive study of the antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds of M. sacchariflorus obtained from different locations in four different countries could provide a comprehensive catalogue of the phytoconstituents and antioxidant properties of M. sac-chariflorus accessions to consumers and nutraceutical industries. A total of 22 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified, among which p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, vitexin, and luteolin were the most dominant phytochemical compounds detected in the majority of the accessions. The antioxidant potential (DPPH) of the leaf extracts of all of the accessions ranged from 28.85 ± 1.53 µg mL−1 in MS-447 to 99.25 ± 1.63 µg mL−1 in MS-190. The antioxidant properties (ABTS) of the leaf extracts of all accessions ranged from 25.65 ± 2.06 in MS-258 to 83.62 ± 2.02 in MS-271. Pearson’s correlation analysis showed a significant and positive correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenolic content, and total flavonoid content varied widely among M. sacchariflorus accessions from the four geographical study regions. A strong and positive association was observed between DPPH with total phenolic content and total flavonoid content. Moderately positive correlations were observed between DPPH scavenging activity with gentisic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, rutin, and quercetin (r = 0.385, r = 0.379, r = 0.362, r = 0.353, r = 0.490, and r = 0.372, respectively), suggesting that phenolic compounds are major contributors to the antioxidant potential of M. sacchariflorus. Thirty-two accessions collected from four different countries (China, Korea, Japan, and Russia) were characterized for 17 quantitative morphological traits. A wide range of diversity was observed in the morphological traits, with plant height ranging from 18.00 ± 1.00 cm to 163.20 ± 4.00 cm. Plant height was significantly correlated with biomass yield (fresh weight; r = 0.439, p &lt; 0.05) and also had moderately positive correlations with culm length (r = 0.356, p &lt; 0.05). Culm length was moderately correlated with the biomass yield fresh weight (r = 0.419*, p &lt; 0.05) and the biomass yield dry weight (r = 0.425*, p &lt; 0.05); however, it exhibited weak and negative correlations with compressed plant circumference (CCirc) (r = −0.374, p &lt; 0.05) and total culm node number (TCmN) (r = −0.440, p &lt; 0.05). Principal components analysis was performed to assess the variation in 17 morphological traits in 32 accessions of M. sacchariflorus. The first two principal components explained 51.24% of the morphological variations. A dendrogram generated from unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering based on morphological characters was not found to be consistent with another dendrogram based on phytochemicals. In both cases, the number of studied accessions collected from different geographical regions grouped into two major groups. However, no clear correlation between these two different approaches was found. The substantial variation in the morphological traits, bioactive properties, and phenolic compounds among the accessions may provide useful information for breeding pro-grams attempting to obtain M. sacchariflorus varieties with improved phenolic compounds traits and improved bioactive properties. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Ethanol production has key differences between the two largest producing countries of this biofuel, Brazil and the USA, such as feedstock source, sugar concentration and ethanol titers in industrial fermentation. Therefore, it is highly probable that these specificities have led to genome adaptation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains employed in each process to tolerate different environments. In order to identify particular adaptations, in this work, we have compared the genomes of industrial yeast strains widely used to produce ethanol from sugarcane, corn and sweet sorghum, and also two laboratory strains as reference. The genes were predicted and then 4524 single-copy orthologous were selected to build the phylogenetic tree. We found that the geographic location and industrial process were shown as the main evolutionary drivers: for sugarcane fermentation, positive selection was identified for metal homeostasis and stress response genes, whereas genes involved in membrane modeling have been connected with corn fermentation. In addition, the corn specialized strain Ethanol Red showed an increased number of copies of MAL31, a gene encoding a maltose transporter. In summary, our work can help to guide new strain chassis selection for engineering strategies, to produce more robust strains for biofuel production and other industrial applications. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In times of global warming caused by the extensive use of fossil fuels, the need to capture gaseous carbon compounds is growing bigger. Several groups of microorganisms can fix the green-house gas CO2. Out of these, acetogenic bacteria are role models in their ability to reduce CO2 with hydrogen to acetate, which makes acetogens prime candidates for genetic modification towards bi-otechnological production of value-added compounds from CO2, such as biofuels. However, growth of acetogens on gaseous substrates is strongly energy-limited, and successful metabolic engineering requires a detailed knowledge of the bioenergetics. In 1939, Clostridium aceticum was the first acetogen to be described. A recent genomic study revealed that this organism contains cyto-chromes and therefore may use a proton gradient in its respiratory chain. We have followed up these studies and will present data that C. aceticum does not use a H+ but a Na+ gradient for ATP synthesis, established by a Na+-Rnf. Experimental data and in silico analyses enabled us to propose the biochemistry and bioenergetics of acetogenesis from H2 + CO2 in C. aceticum. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - β-glucosidase-catalyzed cellobiose conversion to glucose is the principal rate-limiting step in the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel production as most β-glucosidases are feedback inhibited by glucose. Thus, deciphering the mechanism of glucose inhibition has been a prime focus for years. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to understand the effect of low (0.1 M) and high (0.8 M) glucose concentrations on the structure and dynamics of GH1 β-glucosidase (H0HC94) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A. A protein structure network was constructed on each protein snapshot from the simulation, suggesting a glucose-induced conformational change of the enzyme in the high glucose concentration. Additionally, the conformational changes were characterized in terms of cliques and communities. The increasing number of cliques rigidified the residue fluctuations around the enzyme's tunnel in the high glucose concentration and hindered the glucose interaction at the active site. It was also supported by the low radial distribution of glucose and no glucose-enzyme hydrogen bonds at the active site tunnel. Moreover, the essential dynamic motions for catalysis were lost by the elevated number of glucose-enzyme interactions in the high glucose concentration. Furthermore, six secondary binding sites were predicted, which could induce uncompetitive inhibition of H0HC94. Overall, we propose a molecular basis of the H0HC94 inhibition, which will further help to design glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases for sustainable lignocellulosic biofuel production. ©

AB  - Rumen fluid (RF) as inocula is useful for evaluating biomass digestibility and has potential for producing volatile fatty acids (VFA) via the carboxylate platform. However, RF is not readily available, necessitating evaluation of potential preservation methods. Glycerol (50% v/v) and DMSO (5% v/v) were used to preserve rumen inocula for 3 months at −80 °C. Effects of cryo-preservation on digestibility, VFA production and community composition with β-diversity distance metrics were compared to fresh RF using apple, citrus and grape pomace as substrates. For all substrates, DMSO cryo-preserved rumen digestibility parameters, VFA yield and product distribution were more significantly comparable to fresh RF (P > 0.05) than was glycerol cryo-preserved RF. Similarly, β-diversity coefficient (unweighted unifrac) between DMSO cryo-preserved RF and fresh RF was 0.250 while the coefficient was 0.359 for the glycerol cryo-preserved RF compared to fresh RF. This showed that a DMSO cryo-preserved RF is less affected by preservation effects and is a more promising alternative to fresh RF. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nutrient-rich biogas slurry shows favorable prospects for application as an organic fertilizer in farmland. At the same time, due to differing sources and treatment methods, the C/N ratio of biogas slurry varies greatly. The effect of differences in C/N of biogas slurry on soil organic matter properties remains unclear. In this experiment, pig farm biogas slurry differing in C/N (3, 6, 8.84 and 12) was applied instead of fertilizer. Fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis and principal component analysis were used to determine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in soil dissolved organic matter (DOM). The experimental results showed that the DOC and FDOM contents of soil could be significantly increased at the initial stage of biogas slurry application. Compared with CK, on the 60th day, biogas slurry with a C/N of 12 exhibited the greatest improvement in DOC, FDOM as well as for Component 1, Component 2 and Component 3 contents in soil FDOM, 40.93%, 66.25%, 65.35%, 40.47%, and 78.42% respectively. However, compared with the 0th day, by the 60th day, biogas slurry with a C/N of 8.84 exhibited the greatest decrease in Component 4 content in soil FDOM, 74.68%. Biogas slurry with a C/N of 8.84 exerted the greatest promotion effect on corn growth, the utilization and transformation of Component 4 by plants and microorganisms in the soil. And it showed the strongest improvement in the degree of FDOM humification in the soil, the humiﬁcation index increased from 4.16 ± 0.17 to 4.92 ± 0.58, compared with CK. This study provided new insights for the utilization of biogas slurry with respect to soil physical and chemical properties and maize plant growth. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The application of thermal pretreatments to facilitate its anaerobic digestion has associated phenols and furans production, which are commonly identified as inhibitory compounds. Phenols and furans extraction can be done from a liquid phase produced after the thermal pretreatment. In the present study this dephenolized liquid phase (DLP) showed an increase of 42% in methane yield compared to the raw liquid phase (LP) demonstrating the inhibitor character of such compounds. The main extracted phenols and furans were: 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), Hydroxytyrosol (HT), Tyrosol (Ty), Vanillic acid (AcV), Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), Vanillin (V) and Furfural (F).This study also aimed to evaluate the individual effect on methane production of these specific phenols and furans the within the mixture of several ones from LP. The evaluation of the individual compounds over the methanogenesis of a dephenolized liquid phase showed that only V was inhibitory on both methane yield and methane production rate. HMF had a significantly negative effect on methane yield, but improved the methane production rate instead. Ty, F, DHPG and HT favoured the methane yield and production rate. Additionally, it was observed that negative effect of some individual phenols and furans was counteracted by the positive effect of other compounds. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) was applied to isolate four strains of Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum able to grow in the presence of hemicellulosic hydrolysate inhibitors unsupported by the parental strain. Among them, isolate RAC-25 presented the best fermentative performance, producing 22.1 g/L of ABE and 16.7 g/L of butanol. Genome sequencing revealed a deletion in the arabinose transcriptional repressor gene (araR) and a mutation in the anti-sigma factor I that promoted a downregulation of sigI. Gene expression analysis indicated high expression of genes related to H+-pumps (ATP synthases), proline biosynthesis (gamma phosphate reductase) and chaperonins (Grol), suggesting an integrated mechanism that is probably coordinated by the repression of sigI. Therefore, in addition to highlighting the power of ALE for selecting robust strains, our results suggest that sigI and araR may be interesting gene targets for increased tolerance toward inhibitor compounds relevant for lignocellulosic biofuels production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consortium of bacteria (Bacillus toyonensis strain BCT-71120 and Stenotrophomonas rhizophila strain e-p10) can reduce biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) values in aerobic fermentation process of POME. This study aims to degrade the organic and inorganic compounds in POME by using anaerobic bacterial consortium of Bacillus toyonensis strain BCT-71120 and Stenotrophomonas rhizophila strain e-p10 to produce biogas and reduce the values of COD, BOD and total suspended solid (TSS). Effect of fermentation time on TSS, COD, BOD and pH are investigated. Specific growth rate and generation time are determined to obtain optimal fermentation time. The results shows that the bacterial consortium of Bacillus toyonensis strain BCT-7112 and Stenotrophomonas rhizophila strain e-p10 reduced COD, BOD and TSS values of POME and produce methane in biogas for 18 d of anaerobic fermentation process. The highest reduction of COD, BOD and TSS were 86, 94 and 80%, respectively, while the highest methane content was 41.05%. The pH values ranged from 7.8 to 8.3 as sufficient condition for the bacterial growth. The highest specific growth rate of the bacteria achieved at 0.268 1/d and the lowest generation time was 3.74 d. Values of μmax and Ks were achieved 0.174 1/d and 63.011 mg/L, respectively. Value of Y = 1.4 × 109 CFU/mg, Kd = 0.42 1/d and qmax = 1.24 × 10−10 mg/CFU.d based on BOD values. Values of μmax and Ks were achieved 0.122 1/d and 5.945 mg/L, respectively. Y = 2.41 × 109 CFU/mg, Kd = 6.60 1/d and qmax = 5.062 × 10−10 mg/CFU.d. based on COD values. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pretreatment effects and synergistic effects of anaerobic co-digestion of pretreated corn stover (CS) with chicken manure (CM) were studied. Results showed that the NaOH-H2O2 pretreatment effect on CS was better than urea pretreatment in terms of anaerobic digestion promotion. The highest cumulative methane yield of 332.7 mL/g VS added was obtained from the CS (NaOH-H2O2 pretreated)/CM ratio of 1:3, and the highest cumulative methane yield of 319.7 mL/g VS added was obtained from the CS (urea pretreated)/CM ratio of 1:2. Synergistic effects were found in CS (NaOH-H2O2 pretreated)/CM ratios of 2:1, 1:2, 1:3 and CS (urea pretreated)/CM ratios of 1:1, 1:2. Synergistic effect was not found at CS (unpretreated)/CM ratios of 1:2 and 1:3. Pretreatment of CS can produce synergistic effect on anaerobic co-digestion and increase cumulative methane yield by 6.54–24.65%. Among the four kinetic models, modified Gompertz model was best fitted in describing the methane production during anaerobic co-digestion (R2 = 0.9845–0.9988). © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pistachio shell is a lignocellulosic biomass with a high potential to be converted into chemicals, biopolymers, and biofuels. Alkaline pre-treatment is an effective way to extract hemicellulose and increase the cellulose hydrolysis. However, there are some disadvantages to this process, such as a long processing time and the formation of high amounts of degradation products. Microwave irradiation can be used to enhance the effectiveness of alkaline treatment. In this study, microwave-assisted alkali pre-treatment (MAAP) was carried to fractionate pistachio shell into its valuable components (i.e., hemicellulose and cellulose), and the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose-rich residues was performed to produce fermentable sugars. RESULTS: The MAAP conditions (microwave power, NaOH concentration, and pre-treatment time) were studied and optimized by Box–Behnken design to obtain the highest hemicellulose and cellulose yields. Optimal pre-treatment conditions were microwave power of 224 W, NaOH concentration of 1.96 N, and pre-treatment time of 2.63 min. Under these conditions, the recoveries were 58.35% and 92.46% for hemicellulose and cellulose, respectively. Additionally, compositional analysis carried out on the solid and liquid fractions obtained from the pre-treatments indicated that the main components in the liquid phases were xylooligosaccharides (XOS) and the solid phases were enriched in cellulose. MAAP enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis yield, and a maximum glucan to glucose conversion yield of 82.67 mol% was obtained for the solid pre-treated under optimum conditions. CONCLUSION: The studied MAAP process could be an effective and viable option to extract hemicellulose from pistachio shell and increase the enzymatic digestibility of cellulose-rich solid residues. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)

AB  - LONELY GUY has been previously characterized in flowering plants to be involved in the direct activation of cytokinins. In this study, the function of the only LONELY GUY gene (CvarLOG1) from unicellular green microalga Chlorella variabilis NC64A has been investigated. CvarLOG1 expressed mainly in the lag and log phases of growth and was confirmed to be a cytokinin-activating enzyme. Overexpression of CvarLOG1 in Chlorella led to extended life in culture by almost 10–20 days, creating a “stay-green” phenotype. In the transformed alga, the cell cycle was lengthened due to delayed entry into the G2/M phase contrary to the known role of cytokinins in stimulating G2/M transition possibly due to excessive levels of this hormone. However, due to the sustained growth and delayed senescence, there was an increase in cell number by 11% and in biomass by 46% at the stationary phase, indicating a potential application for the biofuel industry. The total carbohydrate and lipid yield increased by approximately 30 and 20%, respectively. RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analysis revealed that the genes associated with light and dark reactions of photosynthesis were upregulated, which may be the reason for the increased biomass. These data show that LOG plays an essential role during the cell cycle and in the functioning of the chloroplast and that the pathway leading to direct activation of cytokinins via LOG is functional in algae. © Copyright © 2021 Nayar.

AB  - Within the domain of phytoremediation research, the proper disposal of harvestable plant parts, that remove pollutants from contaminated soil, has been attracted extensive attention. Here, the bioenergy generation capability of trace metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn, and As) polluted plants was assessed. The biogas production potential of accumulators or hyperaccumulator plants, Elsholtzia haichowensis, Sedum alfredii, Solanum nigrum, Phytolacca americana and Pteris vittata were 259.2 ± 1.9, 238.7 ± 4.2, 135.9 ± 0.9, 129.5 ± 2.9 and 106.8 ± 2.1 mL/g, respectively. The presence of Cu (at approximately 1000 mg/kg) increased the cumulative biogas production, the daily methane production and the methane yield of E. haichowensis. For S. alfredii, the presence of Zn (≥ 500 mg/kg) showed a significant negative impact on the methane content in biogas, and the daily methane production, which decreased the biogas and methane yield. The biogas production potential increased when the content of Mn was at 5 000–10,000 mg/kg, subsequently, decreased when the value of Mn at 20,000 mg/kg. However, Cd (1–200 mg/kg), Pb (125–2000 mg/kg) and As (1250–10,000 mg/kg) showed no distinctive change in the cumulative biogas production of S. nigrum, S. alfredii and P. vittata, respectively. The methane yield showed a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.9704) with cumulative biogas production, and the energy potential of the plant residues were at 415–985 kW h/ton. Thus, the anaerobic digestion has bright potential for the disposal of trace metal contaminated plants, and has promising prospects for the use in energy production. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - A lignocellulosic residue, rice straw, was hydrothermally pretreated for the whole slurry anaerobic digestion. In contrast to the unpretreated rice straw, 110–120 °C pretreatment promoted biogas yield by 35%–38%, while only 14% promotion happened on the pretreatment at 180 °C. To understand why this improvement happened at lower severities, the pretreated rice straw at 90 °C, 120 °C, and 180 °C were selected for the further investigation, in which the liquor and solid fraction were separated for digestion, and compared with the whole slurry digestion. Results indicated more methane was released from the derived liquor of 180 °C than that of 90 °C and 120 °C, however, solid fraction did not exhibit significantly different methane yields (187.77–193.91 mL/g TS). These results suggested that the released soluble fraction from pretreatment could facilitate the methanogenesis. Furthermore, the released inherent soluble fraction in rice straw was mainly responsible for higher biogas yield at lower temperatures. Pretreatment at higher temperatures disintegrated the rice straw recalcitrance more, and intensified the release of soluble fraction accordingly. Consequently, the methanogenesis of whole slurry could be promoted at the initial digestion; the hydrolysis/acidification of the solid fraction in whole slurry was weakened greatly, which resulted in a lower biogas yield. This can also be proved by the evolution of dominant bacteria and archaea in the anaerobic digestion of whole slurry, separated solid and liquor fraction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, a hierarchically porous metal-metalloporphyrin gel (MMPG) based mimic multienzyme system for colorimetric sensing is reported. The synthesis conditions for gel state Fe-MMPG were systematically investigated and the porous structures were readily controlled by varying the reactant concentrations. Based on Fe-MMPG-5 with appropriate mesopores, glucose oxidase encapsulated in Fe-MMPG-5 (GOx@Fe-MMPG-5) with high loading capacity was achieved. The Fe-MMPG-5 provides not only mesopores for enzyme immobilization but also peroxidase-mimic activity in the GOx@Fe-MMPG-5 composite. This multienzyme system was further used for cascade catalysis and colorimetric sensing of glucose with low limit of detection, excellent selectivity and reusability. In additional, this system could also be applied to other oxidases, such as cholesterol oxidase, with intriguing properties. This study combines the advantages of porous gel materials and natural enzymes, providing potential to construct superior biocatalysts for advanced applications in biosensors, industrial catalysis, analytical equipment, and biofuel cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrogenase-catalyzed H2/air biofuel cells have attracted wide attention. However, how to obtain thermostable and highly active hydrogenase remains challenging. Herein, we developed a thermophilic archaea host system to heterologously express a thermostable Pyrococcus furiosus cytoplasmic [NiFe]-hydrogenase I (PfSHI). The recombinant hydrogenase could be easily isolated and then immobilized onto a carbon nanotube-modified carbon felt electrode for further electrochemical characterization. The bioanode was able to work at a wide range of temperatures from 40 °C to 80 °C and no high potential deactivation was observed until 0.3 V at 50 °C. Cyclic voltammograms at elevated temperatures for reverse H2 oxidation performance indicated that an inactive state might be formed and then reversed when scanning to negative position. Also, the power density of a whole cell reached 1.08 mW cm−2 using Pt/C as the cathode with a brilliant open circuit potential reaching 1.2 V. The voltage could retain 90% of its initial value after 33 h discharge at a current of 10 μA. Besides, the bioanode exhibited decent oxygen tolerance both in ambient and elevated temperatures. These results suggest that this recombinant PfSHI can be a good candidate for catalyzing H2/air biofuel cells. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - A biofuel cell that can generate electricity using only water is expected to be used as a new energy harvester for an emergency power supply. A new 4-series/4-parallel structured paper-substrate biofuel cell was prepared using a fuel supply paper preloaded with glucose and phosphate buffer salts. When a power generation test was conducted by supplying water to the fuel-preloaded paper, the paper-based biofuel cell produced an output approximately 90% (0.84 mW) of that obtained by supplying a phosphate buffer containing glucose as the electrolyte. The open-circuit voltage was 2.1 V, and an LED could be powered by simply supplying water to the cell without using a booster circuit. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Microbial β-glucosidases can be used in several industrial processes, including production of biofuels, functional foods, juices, and beverages. In the present work, production of β-glucosidase by solid state cultivation of the fungus Thermoascus crustaceus in a low-cost cultivation medium (comprising agroindustrial residues) was evaluated. The highest production of β-glucosidase, about 415.1 U/g substrate (or 41.51 U/mL), was obtained by cultivating the fungus in wheat bran with 70% humidity, during 96 h at 40°C. The enzymatic activity was optimum at pH 4.5 and 65°C. β-Glucosidase maintained its catalytic activity when incubated at a pH range of 4.0-8.0 and temperature of 30-55°C. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by glucose; even when the substrate and glucose concentrations were equal, the inhibition was not reversed, suggesting a non-competitive inhibition. In the presence of up to 10% ethanol, β-glucosidase maintained its catalytic activity. In addition to β-glucosidase, the enzymatic extract showed activity of 36 U/g for endoglucanase, 256.2 U/g for xylanase, and 18.2 U/g for β-xylosidase. The results allow to conclude that the fungus T. crustaceus has considerable potential for production of β-glucosidase and xylanase when cultivated in agroindustrial residues, thereby reducing the cost of these biocatalysts. © 2021, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Biochar is a carbon-rich stable substance, defined as charred organic matter, produced during biomass thermochemical decomposition, and its application is currently considered as a mean of enhancing soil productivity, which is an important requirement for increasing crop yields whereas, simultaneously, it improves the quality of contaminated soil and water. However, depending on pedoclimatic conditions, its applicability exhibits negative aspects as well. It can also support biofuel production, therefore helping in reducing the demand for fossil fuels. Biochar is providing ecosystem services such as immobilization and transformation of contaminants and mitigation of climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing the release of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide and methane. It can further reduce waste as it could be produced from everything that contains biomass thereby assisting in waste management. Due to such wide-ranging applications, this review was conceptualized to emphasize the importance of biochar as an alternative to classic products used for energy, environmental and agricultural purposes. Based on the detailed information on the factors impacting biochar properties, the benefits and limitations of biochar, and the potential application guidelines for growers, this work aimed to help in partial achievement of multiple environmental goals and a practical recommendation to growers although its large-scale application is still controversial. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - Microalgae are rich source of lipids and are one of the promising feedstocks for biofuel production, whereas enhancement of lipid, carbohydrate, and biomass production is crucial for commercialization of algal biofuels. Nutrients/salinity stresses are important to increase the synthesis of lipid. In the present study, Scenedesmus sp. is treated with a varying combination of sodium nitrate (NaNO3), dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4), and sodium chloride (NaCl) to improve lipid accumulation. Results indicate that the modified media comprising of NaCl (100 mM), NaNO3 (0 mM), and K2HPO4 (0.22 mM) (S100N0P0.22) accumulated higher quantities of lipid (385.4 ± 34.2 μg/mg) along with considerable biomass (537.0 ± 22.3 μg/mL), chlorophyll “a” (6.2 ± 0.08 μg/mL), and palmitic acid (32.6%). Apart from biochemical analysis, stress-induced biomarker such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was observed maximum for same combination (10854 μmolH2O2/g), with low lipid peroxidation (3.2 μmol/g). Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were further studied to monitor the impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on lipid accumulation. This study revealed a better combination in terms of lipid and biomass profile, which can further be investigated for large-scale production. Multi-stress-driven lipid production is one of the significant outputs of the current study, which can further be explored in detail. Insight such interactions may provide directions for economical production of algal biodiesel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass includes a pretreatment step to alter the biomass structure and facilitate the enzymatic degradation of the polymers to obtain assimilable compounds. In this study, agave bagasse (AB) was used as a feedstock for obtaining methane, for which AB was pretreated with steam explosion and enzymatically hydrolyzed. The pretreatment conditions corresponded to severity factors (SFs) within a range from 1.65 to 2.89, while enzymatic hydrolysis was performed with enzyme loads of Cellic CTec2 within a range from 0.12 to 3.6 mgprotein g−1AB. The best global yields (including pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis) of total carbohydrates (TCs), glucose (GLU), xylose (XYL), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 0.7 g TC g−1AB, 0.12 g GLU g−1AB, 0.03 g XYL g−1AB, and 0.20 g O2 g−1AB obtained using 2.4 mgprotein g−1AB of Cellic CTec2 with agave bagasse pretreated with an SF of 2.41. The contribution of pretreatment to the global TC yield ranged from 13 to 34% for the different systems evaluated. The biochemical potential of methane (BMP) of hydrolysates (pretreatment at SF 2.41 and 2.4 mgprotein g−1AB of Cellic CTec2) was 0.284 ± 0.02 in NL CH4 g−1 COD with a COD removal of 78.4 ± 1.3. This BMP value was 40% higher than the BMP obtained in the system without enzymatic hydrolysis, indicating the impact of this step on conversion to biomethane. The results at the BMP level indicated the potential of this residue for biofuel production.

AB  - Due to an increasing demand for environmentally sustainable products, miscanthus and maize stover represent interesting lignocellulosic resources for conversion into biofuels and biomaterials. The overall purpose was to compare miscanthus and maize regarding cell-wall composition and stem anatomy for conversion into bioethanol and polymer composites using partial least squares regressions. For each of the two crops, six contrasted genotypes were cultivated in complete block design, and harvested. Internodes below the main cob for maize, and on the first aboveground internode for miscanthus, were analyzed for biochemistry and anatomy. Their digestibility was predicted using crop-specific near infrared calibrations, and the mechanical properties were evaluated in stem-based composites. On average, the internode cross-section of miscanthus anatomy was characterized by a thick rind (26.2%) and few but dense pith-bundles (3.5 nb/mm2), while cell-wall constituted 95.2% of the dry matter with high lignin (243.2 mg/g) and cellulose concentrations (439.7 mg/g). Maize internode-anatomy showed large cross-sections (397.5 mm2), pith with the presence of numerous bundles and non-lignified-pith fractions (22.3% of the section). Its cell-wall biochemistry displayed high concentrations of hemicelluloses, galactose, arabinose, xylose, and ferulic acid. Cell-wall, lignin, and cellulose concentrations were positively correlated with rind-fraction and pith-bundle-density, which explained strong mechanical properties as shown in miscanthus. Hemicelluloses, galactose, arabinose, and ferulic acid concentrations were positively correlated with pith fraction and stem cross-section, revealing high digestibility as shown in maize. This underlines interesting traits for further comparative genetic studies, as maize represents a good model for digestibility and miscanthus for composites. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Marine diatoms are a potential source for lipids and carbohydrates, which can have several applications ranging from biofuels to nutraceuticals. Due to their siliceous cellular structure and the complex nature of different lipid classes, it is important to understand the effect of biomass pre-treatment on the extractability of marine diatom lipids. In the present study, we tested the effect of four biomass pre-treatments (acid, base, anionic detergent, and non-ionic detergent) conditions on the extractability of lipids from Amphora sp. biomass. Lipids were extracted under identical supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) conditions from each of the above mentioned pre-treated biomass of Amphora sp. grown with or without silica. The fatty acids profile of saponified lipids was analysed by LC-MS. Results obtained in this study suggest each pre-treatment has a specific effect on the fatty acids profile. Therefore, depending on the downstream application of lipids (biodiesel or nutritional), both types of biomass and their pre-treatment conditions need to be considered. From the fermentation study for biomass evaluation as bioethanol feedstock, it was found that the complex carbohydrates of Amphora sp. biomass were easily convertible by autoclaving to monomer sugars, which were suitable for bioethanol production by yeast fermentation. © 2021

AB  - Filamentous fungi of the genus Aspergillus are of particular interest for biotechnological applications due to their natural capacity to secrete carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) that target plant biomass. The presence of easily metaboliz-able sugars such as glucose, whose concentrations increase during plant biomass hydrolysis, results in the repression of CAZy-encoding genes in a process known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR), which is undesired for the purpose of large-scale enzyme production. To date, the C2H2 transcription factor CreA has been described as the major CC repressor in Aspergillus spp., although little is known about the role of posttranslational modifications in this process.In this work, phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometry on Aspergillus nidulans CreA, and subsequently, the previously identified but uncharacterized site S262, the characterized site S319, and the newly identifiedsitesS268andT308werechosentobemutated to nonphosphorylatable residues before their effect on CCR was investigated. Sites S262, S268, and T308 are important for CreA protein accumulation and cellular localization, DNA binding, and repression of enzyme activities. In agreement with a previous study, site S319 was not important for several here-tested phenotypes but is key for CreA degradation and induction of enzyme activities. All sites were shown to be important for glycogen and trehalose metabolism. This study highlights the importance of CreA phos-phorylation sites for the regulation of CCR. These sites are interesting targets for bio-technological strain engineering without the need to delete essential genes, which could result in undesired side effects. IMPORTANCE In filamentous fungi, the transcription factor CreA controls carbohydrate metabolism through the regulation of genes encoding enzymes required for the use of alternative carbon sources. In this work, phosphorylation sites were identified on Aspergillus nidulans CreA, and subsequently, the two newly identified sites S268 and T308, the previously identified but uncharacterized site S262, and the previously characterized site S319 were chosen to be mutated to nonphosphorylatable residues before their effect on CCR was characterized. Sites S262, S268, and T308 are important for CreA protein accumulation and cellular localization, DNA binding, and repression of enzyme activities. In agreement with a previous study, site S319 is not important for several here-tested phenotypes but is key for CreA degradation and induction of enzyme activities. This work characterized novel CreA phosphorylation sites under carbon catabolite-repressing conditions and showed that they are crucial for CreA protein turnover, control of carbohydrate utilization, and biotechnologically relevant enzyme production. © 2021 de Assis et al.

AB  - Third-generation biofuels are gaining commercial interest because of the rapid growth rate, high productivity of nutrients, and the carbon dioxide sequestration ability of the feedstock, algae. But the selection of algae, cultivation method, and pretreatment techniques remain challenging. The present work describes the high suitability of brown seaweed as a promising feedstock for the production of bioethanol. Sargassum cinereum is a carbohydrate-rich and fast-growing brown seaweed in all marine environments and abundantly available in Gulf of Mannar, India. Proximate, ultimate, and biochemical analysis has demonstrated the potential carbohydrates in the brown seaweed composition. Preliminary studies on S. cinereum revealed that the H2SO4-assisted hydrolysis had produced more fermentable sugars than the tested. A statistical optimization method with 16 runs was employed to optimize the H2SO4 loading concentration (% w/v), residence time (min), and incubation temperature (°C) for the enhancement of fermentable sugars from the biomass. Optimization results have shown a 133% increase in reducing sugars yield. Furthermore, the obtained sugars were fermented to ethanol at a yield of 0.465 ± 0.024 g ethanol/reducing sugars using Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC170. The observed high ethanol yield from seaweed sugars was closer to the theoretical yield based on glucose as a substrate. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study presents ethanol's fabrication by fermenting the golden trumpet flower (Allamanda schottii L) with the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The changes in different parameters during fermentation were studied and optimized while producing the ethanol and the end product was subjected to emission test study by blending petrol and ethanol. The Allamanda floral substrate contains 65% polysaccharides. The strain S. cerevisiae was obtained in the form of baker's yeast from a domestic shop. For 100 ml of slurry, the highest bioethanol yield recorded was about 18.75 ml via optimization of different culture conditions, including a 1:8 ratio for slurry preparation, maintained under 35 ⁰C, 5.5 pH, 72 h. old inoculum with a quantity of 3.75 g 100 ml−1, fermented for120 h. The highest yield of bioethanol was acquired under the addition of urea. This technique &amp; design is capable of industrial-scale fabrication of bioethanol by using A. schottii floral substrates. This research was conducted to fabricate ethanol by fermentation (A. schottii L) floral substrate with S. cerevisiae. The optimum physiochemical parameters required to obtain the highest yield of bioethanol from A. schottii flower by fermentation was studied. The immobilization strategy with a cheap agricultural substrate and magnetic nanoparticles were also studied. The engine performance and emission studies were done with different blends of petrol and bio-ethanol. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Clostridium diolis DSM 15410 is a type strain of solventogenic clostridium capable of conducting isopropanol-butanol-ethanol fermentation. By studying its growth on different carbohydrates, we verified its ability to utilize glycerol and produce 1,3-propanediol and discovered its ability to produced isopropanol. Complete genome sequencing showed that its genome is a single circular chromosome and belongs to the cluster I (sensu scricto) of the genus Clostridium. By cultivation analysis we highlighted its specific behavior in comparison to two selected closely related strains. Despite the fact that several CRISPR loci were found, 16 putative prophages showed the ability to receive foreign DNA. Thus, the strain has the necessary features for future engineering of its 1,3-propanediol biosynthetic pathway and for the possible industrial utilization in the production of biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To reduce the cost of lignocellulosic pretreatment, rice straw was ensiled with dilute formic acid (FA, 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6%) for 3, 6, 9, 15 and 30 days, and evaluated its effects on fermentation dynamics, lignocellulosic degradation and enzymatic hydrolysis. The results showed that the application of FA, especially at 0.6% level, reduced total fermentation losses of the resulting silages, as evidenced by low dry matter loss, ammonia nitrogen and ethanol content. Meanwhile, the 0.6% FA application promoted hemicellulose removal (232.41 vs 187.52 g/kg DM) and xylose production (0.35 vs 2.80 g/kg DM). The glucose yield and cellulose convertibility of rice straw increased after 30 days of ensiling, and further enhanced by the 0.6% FA application. In conclusion, the 0.6% FA-assisted ensiling pretreatment improved both biomass preservation, hemicellulose removal and enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw, which is beneficial to the subsequent biofuel production chain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Extractives are nonstructural constituents of lignocellulosic materials available in small portions; however, their influence on the bioconversion processes cannot be disregarded. This study evaluated the effect of various concentrations of rice straw water extractives (RWE) and ethanol extractives (REE) on enzymatic hydrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation productivity. By increasing the RWE or REE concentration, the glucose yield did not change after 72 h of enzymatic hydrolysis. The RWE increment enhanced ethanol yield to 95.6%. However, the REE increment decreased ethanol yield to 32.1%. Adding RWE caused a considerable reduction in the accumulated biogas and changed the composition of produced biogas from 74% methane to less than 1%. By increasing the REE concentration, the accumulated biogas increased from 167.9 to 524.4 ml/g VS. According to the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) results, the most abundant RWE and REE components were 3-hydroxy-Spirost-8-en-11-one and guaiazulene, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant and renewable feedstock for biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials. To make this recalcitrant biomass more susceptible to hydrolysis and microbial conversion a pretreatment is required. Many pretreatments have resulted in high sugar yields; however, they can generate microbial inhibitory compounds in the fermentation step. Therefore, the detoxification of hydrolysates is necessary. This study shows that reduced graphene oxide adorned with magnetite nanoparticles (rGO-MNPs) can adsorb inhibitory compounds such as furfural. Adsorption tests were performed in both aqueous solutions (furfural and furfural-glucose) and wood hydrolysate. rGO-MNPs (20 mg) removed 68% of furfural when it was alone, 49% of furfural when it was mixed with glucose and 20% of furfural in the wood hydrolysate. Among the adsorption of furfural in wood hydrolysate, rGO-MNPs adsorbed other lignin derivate compounds. Finally, no toxic effect of rGO-MNPs on R. toruloides-1588 was observed during the fermentation using detoxified wood hydrolysate. © 2020

AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a promising waste-to-energy alternative technology. However, the efficiency upgrading for conventional mesophilic digestion of organic solid waste is always indispensable. Employing hyperthermophilic or thermophilic microbial community is one of the viable upgrading alternatives. Given the unavailability of the superior microbial communities, mesophilic digested sludge was used as inoculum, and instantly controlled at 70 °C and 55 °C for acclimation of hyperthermophilic and thermophilic inocula, respectively. Waste activated sludge was continuously and synchronously fed into two digesters. After one round, thermophilic digester achieved stable biogas production rate at 0.22 L L−1 d−1, with a methane proportion over 60%, whereas fluctuation was observed in the hyperthermophilic digester, and approximately triple time was needed to reach a relatively stable biogas production rate 0.12 L L−1 d−1. Nevertheless, higher hydrolysis ratio 24.4% was observed in the hyperthermophilic digester despite the lower biogas production. Therefore, methanogenesis step limited the whole anaerobic process for the hyperthermophilic digestion, and digestion at 70 °C was appropriate as a pre-fermentation stage to enhanced hydrolysis. The genus Methanothrix proportion in the thermophilic digester gradually decreased, while another acetoclastic genus Methanosarcina ultimately was acclimated to the dominant methanogen. In addition to Methanothrix, hydrogenotrophic archaea became competitive in the hyperthermophilic digester, with Methanothermobacter dominant at 22.6%. The genus Psychrobacter, affiliated to the phylum Proteobacteria could survive better than the others at 70 °C, with a final proportion of 62.5%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High-temperature bioconversion of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars has drawn attention for efficient production of renewable chemicals and biofuels, because competing microbial activities are inhibited at elevated temperatures and thermostable cell wall degrading enzymes are superior to mesophilic enzymes. Here, we report on the development of a platform to produce four different thermostable cell wall degrading enzymes in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The enzyme blend was composed of the cellobiohydrolase CBM3GH5 from C. saccharolyticus, the β-glucosidase celB from P. furiosus, the endoglucanase B and the endoxylanase XynA from T. neapolitana. In addition, transplastomic microalgae were engineered for the expression of phosphite dehydrogenase D from Pseudomonas stutzeri, allowing for growth in non-axenic media by selective phosphite nutrition. The cellulolytic blend composed of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) domain GH12/GH5/GH1 allowed the conversion of alkaline-treated lignocellulose into glucose with efficiencies ranging from 14% to 17% upon 48h of reaction and an enzyme loading of 0.05% (w/w). Hydrolysates from treated cellulosic materials with extracts of transgenic microalgae boosted both the biogas production by methanogenic bacteria and the mixotrophic growth of the oleaginous microalga Chlorella vulgaris. Notably, microalgal treatment suppressed the detrimental effect of inhibitory by-products released from the alkaline treatment of biomass, thus allowing for efficient assimilation of lignocellulose-derived sugars by C. vulgaris under mixotrophic growth. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The influences of nutritional components affecting lipase production from the new Aspergillus niger using wheat bran as substrate were studied by employing Plackett–Burman and central composite statistical designs. Out of the 11 medium components tested, sucrose, KH2PO4 and MgSO4 at final concentrations of 3.0, 1.0 and 0.5 g/L, respectively, were reported to contribute positively to enzyme production (20.09 ± 0.98 U/g ds). The enzyme was purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. Molecular mass of the purified lipase was 57 kDa as evident on SDS-PAGE. Different methods of immobilization were studied and the highest immobilization yield of 81.7 ± 2.18% was reported with agarose (2%) and the optimum temperature was raised from 45 to 50 °C. Immobilized lipase could retain 80% of its original activity at 60 °C after 1 hr of incubation, and was stable at pH values between neutral and alkaline pH. Lipase-catalyzed transesterification process of fungal oil resulted in a fatty acid methyl ester yield consisting of a high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (83.6%), making it appropriate to be used as winter-grade biodiesel. The operational stability studies revealed that the immobilized lipase could keep 70% of its total activity after 5 cycles of the transesterification process. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Renewable biomasses are used worldwide as inputs for energy production through processes, like Anaerobic Digestion (AD), which is a well-established technology to transform them into bio-gas and other by-products. Maize, triticale, sunflower and sorghum are energy crops frequently used as feedstocks in AD applications, mainly because of their high biogas potential. However, their cultivation generates some negative environmental impacts due to the direct and indirect land use changes. Therefore, it is important to seek for alternative species to replace some of them with others with lower environmental impacts while producing comparable biogas and energy yields. Industrial Hemp (IH) was documented in this literature review to be a suitable crop for AD applications with yields that are highly competitive with those of the energy crops being used now. Additionally, this literature review provided insight into the diversity of the methane yielding parts of the IH plants, with fresh leaves yielding the highest quantities. Finally, the authors of this literature review highlighted the need for research and development designed to expand the usage of IH as green biomass in AD plants, for efficient production of biogas and organic nutrients, and thereby, contributing to transitioning toward low fossil-carbon footprint societies.

AB  - Second-generation bioethanol derived from native perennial grasses offers a promising alternative for biofuel, especially when the biomass avoids land-use competition for crop production. Panicum prionitis Ness is a native perennial C4 grass predominant in soils of the Delta del Paraná River, Argentina. Its forage quality (palatability and digestibility) for livestock is low because of its substantial lignin content. In this work, we evaluated different pretreatments (phosphoric acid, ligninolytic enzymes and fungal secretomes) aimed to degrade lignin and improve cellulose hydrolysis efficiency. Results show that 2-day pretreatments with fungal secretomes highly improve release of fermentable sugars compared with conventional pretreatments. Although Pycnoporus sanguineus displayed a greater contribution than Ganoderma applanatum to the pretreatment, the latter triggered the highest final yield, achieving a hydrolysis of 47.5% of cellulose when added to green tissue. These results strengthen the feasibility of using Panicum prionitis biomass in a low-polluting bioethanol production process. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) is a rose-scented flavor and fragrance compound that is used in food, beverages, and personal care products. Compatibility with gasoline also makes it a potential biofuel or fuel additive. A biochemical process converting glucose or other fermentable sugars to 2-PE can potentially provide a more sustainable and economical production route than current methods that use chemical synthesis and/or isolation from plant material. Results: We work toward this goal by engineering the Shikimate and Ehrlich pathways in the stress-tolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus. First, we develop a multigene integration tool that uses CRISPR-Cas9 induced breaks on the genome as a selection for the one-step integration of an insert that encodes one, two, or three gene expression cassettes. Integration of a 5-kbp insert containing three overexpression cassettes successfully occurs with an efficiency of 51 ± 9% at the ABZ1 locus and was used to create a library of K. marxianus CBS 6556 strains with refactored Shikimate pathway genes. The 33-factorial library includes all combinations of KmARO4, KmARO7, and KmPHA2, each driven by three different promoters that span a wide expression range. Analysis of the refactored pathway library reveals that high expression of the tyrosine-deregulated KmARO4K221L and native KmPHA2, with the medium expression of feedback insensitive KmARO7G141S, results in the highest increase in 2-PE biosynthesis, producing 684 ± 73 mg/L. Ehrlich pathway engineering by overexpression of KmARO10 and disruption of KmEAT1 further increases 2-PE production to 766 ± 6 mg/L. The best strain achieves 1943 ± 63 mg/L 2-PE after 120 h fed-batch operation in shake flask cultures. Conclusions: The CRISPR-mediated multigene integration system expands the genome-editing toolset for K. marxianus, a promising multi-stress tolerant host for the biosynthesis of 2-PE and other aromatic compounds derived from the Shikimate pathway. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae has been proposed as a viable alternative method for novel high-value biomolecules, enriched biomass, and biofuel production because of their allowance of high cell density levels, as well as simple production technology. Tetradesmus bernardii, a newly isolated high-yielding oleaginous microalga under photoautotrophic conditions, is able to grow heterotrophically, meaning that it can consume organic carbon sources in dark condition. We investigated the effect of different carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios on the growth and lipid accumulation of T. bernardii in heterotrophic batch culture under two nitrogen sources (NaNO3 and CO(NH2)2). In addition, we conducted time-resolved transcriptome analysis to reveal the metabolic mechanism of T. bernardii in heterotrophic culture. Results: T. bernardii can accumulate high biomass concentrations in heterotrophic batch culture where the highest biomass of 46.09 g/L was achieved at 100 g/L glucose concentration. The rate of glucose to biomass exceeded 55% when the glucose concentration was less than 80 g/L, and the C/N ratio was 44 at urea treatment. The culture was beneficial to lipid accumulation at a C/N ratio between 110 and 130. NaNO3 used as a nitrogen source enhanced the lipid content more than urea, and the highest lipid content was 45% of dry weight. We performed RNA-seq to analyze the time-resolved transcriptome of T. bernardii. As the nitrogen was consumed in the medium, nitrogen metabolism-related genes were significantly up-regulated to speed up the N metabolic cycle. As chloroplasts were destroyed in the dark, the metabolism of cells was transferred from chloroplasts to cytoplasm. However, storage of carbohydrate in chloroplast remained active, mainly the synthesis of starch, and the precursor of starch synthesis in heterotrophic culture may largely come from the absorption of organic carbon source (glucose). With regard to lipid metabolism, the related genes of fatty acid synthesis in low nitrogen concentration increased gradually with the extension of cultivation time. Conclusion: T. bernardii exhibited rapid growth and high lipid accumulation in heterotrophic culture. It may be a potential candidate for biomass and biofuel production. Transcriptome analysis showed that multilevel regulation ensured the conversion from carbon to the synthesis of carbohydrate and lipid. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Inefficient waste management and associated environmental pollution are exhausting societies’ precious renewable resources. Moreover, their effects on human health adversely affect the global economic scenario. These adverse effects are a constant cause of concern for environmental and health management. This review presents alternatives to uneconomical and non-eco-friendly methods for waste management and treatment. The multistep microbial anaerobic digestion (AD) process has the potential to metabolize up to 95% of organic matter to energy-rich methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide. The intermediates of AD can be transformed into value-added products, such as hydrogen (H2), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), and CH4. The unique feature of these value-added products is their eco-friendly nature (non-polluting and biodegradable). The use of biowaste as feed makes the process economical. A few limiting factors that must be circumvented include (i) the slow metabolic rates of methanogens, (ii) high susceptibility to oxygen concentrations, and (iii) the complexity of biowaste. Here, we focus on using biowaste as a feed for integrating dark-fermentative H2 production processes with those of i) photo-fermentative H2, ii) PHAs, and (iii) CH4. This strategy could encourage a transition to an economy based on sustainable waste management and energy generation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As plastics have been omnipresent in society ever since their introduction in 1907, global plastic production has ballooned in the 20th century or the Plasticene Era (Plastic Age). After their useful life span, they deliberately or accidentally, are disposed of in the environment. Influenced by different factors, plastics undergo fragmentation into microplastics (MPs) and present hazardous risks in all life forms including humans. Obliterating MPs from the environment has been a global challenge for the attainment of sustainable development goals (SDGs). This review aims to present MP degradation routes with a great focus on the thermodegradation and biodegradation routes as sustainable routes of MP degradation. These routes can achieve the reduction and obliteration of MPs in the environment, thus reducing their hazardous effects. Moreover, the thermodegradation of MPs can produce fuels that help solve the dilemma of energy security. Overall, continued research and development are still needed, however, these novel approaches and the increased awareness of the microplastics’ hazards give us hope that we can achieve sustainable development in the near future. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - In this report, we demonstrate the advantages of the dual-mode operation of an enzymatic biosupercapacitor with nanostructured polypyrrole/nanocellulose, gold nanoparticle-based paper electrodes, sucrose as the anode fuel and molecular oxygen as the oxidant. The device allowed conversion of the sucrose biofuel, and offered storage of the generated power in the same, small-scale device. The external and internal biosupercapacitor re-charging modes were compared. The specific capacitance of the device was 1.8 F cm−2 at a discharge current density of 1 mA cm−2. The cell used in the charge/discharge mode of operation allowed retention of 49% of the initial capacitance after eight days of exhaustive discharging under external load. The discontinuous capacitive mode, preserved the biocatalysts activity for much longer time. The use of such enzyme-based electrical energy sources in the capacitive mode i.e. under discontinuous charging was demonstrated as a solution for preserving high specific capacitance and long-term operational stability. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters was studied using MCM-41 mesoporous silica-supported Pd-Pt bimetallic catalysts with tunable porosity under mild reaction conditions (100 °C, 0.4 MPa H2, 4 h). This process produced partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME) as a new type of high-quality biodiesel fuel enriched in monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME), which is a potential source for formulating high blends of biodiesel fuel with petrodiesel. MCM-41 supports with various structural properties and morphologies were synthesized by self-assembly with different amounts of ammonia solution as a mineralizing agent. Bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles with a Pd/Pt atomic ratio of 4 were stepwise impregnated on three MCM-41 supports, resulting in a series of Pd-Pt/MCM-41 bimetallic catalysts with tunable porosity (0.89–1.79 cm3 g−1), average pore size (3.2–8.5 nm), and particle size (0.12–0.62 μm). The Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst prepared with the least amount of ammonia produced the best partial hydrogenation conversion of polyunsaturated FAME into mono-FAME, ascribed to nano-aggregation resulting in a dual-pore system containing large pores for fast molecular diffusion; a high turnover frequency (1920 h−1), larger k1 rate constant (0.60 gcat−1h−1), and smaller k2 rate constant (0.37 gcat−1h−1) were obtained. Furthermore, this Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibited excellent sulfur resistance in the synthesis of H-FAME, even though the feedstocks contained approximately 5 ppm of sulfur contaminates. These results demonstrate that the sulfur-resistant Pd-Pt/MCM-41 bimetallic catalysts with stable and dual pore system are beneficial for obtaining higher quality BDF to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Flexible and wearable epidermal biofuel cells (BFCs) that are worn on skin for the direct electricity generation from human perspiration are perceived to be a most enticing and promising next-generation energy source for addressing the on-body energy-harvesting challenge of wearable electronics. Previously reported epidermal BFCs are only focused on the utilization of human endogenous substances (i.e., glucose or lactate that can be produced by human body) in sweat as the biofuels for power production. Given the substances diversity in human body, some exogenous substances (that cannot be produced by body) are abundant in sweat in certain daily situations, however, their utility for epidermal bioenergy harvesting has been ignored so far. In the present work, we propose the first example of a flexible and wearable epidermal microfluidic human exogenous substance ethanol/oxygen BFC for the simultaneous sweat sampling and sweat bioelectricity generation on skin of individuals who drink alcohol. Certain actual situations that were associated with alcohol absorption and elimination in human body were considered and investigated for skin-on, continuous in situ sweat ethanol bioenergy generation in controlled environments. Such non-invasive flexible and wearable epidermal ethanol BFC expands the scope of human sweat-derived biofuels from endogenous substances to exogenous ones and holds great promise for the skin-worn and real-time bioenergy harvesting from human perspiration, which may open up a new challenge and approach to explore the human sweat for bioenergy conversion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica is considered a promising platform for the sustainable production of high-value lipids and biofuel feedstocks. However, current lipid yields of N. oceanica are too low for economic feasibility. Gaining fundamental insights into the lipid metabolism of N. oceanica could open up various possibilities for the optimization of this species through genetic engineering. Therefore, the aim of this study was to discover novel genes associated with an elevated neutral lipid content. We constructed an insertional mutagenesis library of N. oceanica, selected high lipid mutants by five rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and identified disrupted genes using a novel implementation of a rapid genotyping procedure. One particularly promising mutant (HLM23) was disrupted in a putative APETALA2-like transcription factor gene. HLM23 showed a 40%-increased neutral lipid content, increased photosynthetic performance, and no growth impairment. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed an upregulation of genes related to plastidial fatty acid biosynthesis, glycolysis and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in HLM23. Insights gained in this work can be used in future genetic engineering strategies for increased lipid productivity of Nannochloropsis. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The anaerobic co-digestion (coAD) of swine manure (SM) and rice straw (RS) is appealing for renewable energy recovery and waste treatment worldwidely. Improving its performance is very important for its application. In this study, long-term semi-continuous experiments were conducted to evaluate the improving effects of digestate recirculation on the performance, energy recovery, and microbial community of two-stage thermophilic-mesophilic coAD of swine manure (SM) and rice straw (RS). The experimental results indicated that the coAD systems of SM and RS (mixing ratio of 3:1) with or without digestate recirculation could not realize phase separation. The reactors of both coAD systems were characterized by pH values ranging from 7.74 to 7.85, methane production as 0.41 ± 0.02 and 0.44 ± 0.03 L/L/d, and stable operation. Notably, digestate recirculation increased total methane production, organic matter removal, and reaction rate of the coAD system by 9.92 ± 5.08, 5.22 ± 1.94, and 9.73–12.60%, respectively. Digestate recirculation improved the performance of the coAD by significantly increasing the abundance of Methanosarcina (from 4.1% to 7.5%–10.7% and 35.7%) and decreasing that of Methanothermobacter (from 94.2% to 87.3%–83.6% and 56.8%). Thus, the main methanogenesis pathway of the coAD system was changed by digestate recirculation and the methane production was effectively improved. Although the energy input of the coAD system increased by 30.26%, digestate recirculation improved the energy balance of the total system by 6.83%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, an amine-coordinated cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)-based anodic catalyst was fabricated by a facile process, to enhance the performance of hydrogen peroxide fuel cells (HPFCs) and enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs). For this purpose, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was added onto the reduced graphene oxide and CoPc composite (RGO/CoPc) to create abundant NH2 axial ligand groups, for anchoring the Co core within the CoPc. Owing to the PEI addition, the onset potential of the hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction was shifted by 0.13 V in the negative direction (0.02 V) and the current density was improved by 1.92 times (1.297 mA cm−2), compared to those for RGO/CoPc (0.15 V and 0.676 mA cm−2, respectively), due to the formation of donor–acceptor dyads and the prevention of CoPc from leaching out. The biocatalyst using glucose oxidase (GOx) ([RGO/CoPc]/PEI/GOx) showed a better onset potential and catalytic activity (0.15 V and 318.7 μA cm−2) than comparable structures, as well as significantly improved operational durability and long-term stability. This is also attributed to PEI, which created a favorable microenvironment for the enzyme. The maximum power densities (MPDs) and open-circuit voltages (OCVs) obtained for HPFCs and EBCs using the suggested catalyst were 105.2 ± 1.3 μW cm−2 (0.317 ± 0.003 V) and 25.4 ± 0.9 μW cm−2 (0.283 ± 0.007 V), respectively. This shows that the amine axial ligand effectively improves the performance of the actual driving HPFCs and EBCs. © 2020 Science Press

AB  - Pretreatment of renewable lignocellulosic biomass is essential to produce fermentable sugars and biofuels in a sustainable biorefinery. However, lignin repolymerization during pretreatment was reported to intensify lignin inhibition in the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. Seeking green additives to mitigate lignin inhibition is of great significance for sustainable lignocellulosic biorefinery. In this work, green additives, mannitol and syringic acid, were thoroughly evaluated for improving the dilute acid pretreatment efficacy of hardwood. The results showed that these additives used in dilute acid pretreatment altered the structure and physicochemical properties of lignin, thus mitigating lignin inhibition on cellulose hydrolysis. In detail,31P NMR results showed evidently higher aliphatic OH groups of lignin after mannitol addition. The 2D HSQC NMR analysis exhibited more β-O-4 and fewer β-β structures, while GPC analysis showed a lower molecular weight of lignin. Results indicated that mannitol was incorporated into the lignin structure to form etherified lignin with plenty of hydroxyl tails, which suppressed lignin repolymerization. As a result, the surface barrier effect of lignin was largely diminished by mannitol addition, leading to improved ease of cellulose hydrolysis by up to 53%. As far as we know, mannitol as an additive in biomass pretreatment has not been reported. This work presented novel green additives to suppress lignin repolymerization for boosting enzymatic saccharification of cellulose in a sustainable lignocellulosic biorefinery. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Developing countries located in the tropics have favorable climates to develop modern agriculture and agriculture-based industry. Peru and Indonesia are examples of two developing countries located in the tropics with economies based on the export of agricultural products. The generation of agricultural and forest residues has continuously increased in these countries. In this paper, we analyze the availability of agricultural and forest products in Peru and Indonesia in order to calculate the number of residues that could potentially be used for different applications such as energy generation and composite materials production. A single index taking into account the technical, economic, and environmental performance of these residues-based products was utilized to compare them. The results showed that, in addition to the generation of energy, the production of plastic bio-based composites and activated carbon are viable alternatives for the use of these residues. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Wheat straw (Triticum aestivum) is one of the lignocellulosic materials largely available worldwide and could be potentially used for biofuel production. Aiming the cost-effective utilization of wheat straw in the sugar-based biorefineries, co-cultures of Trichoderma reesei and Monascus purpureus were used for the enzymatic hydrolysis of the wheat straw biomass. The enzymatic breakdown of the dual-fungi-treated wheat straw was chemically analyzed through different enzyme/compositional assays, and the structural modifications were studied through scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). For hydrolytic enzyme assays, the co-culture treatments resulted in significantly higher values (carboxymethyl cellulase (212.3 U/ml; p = 0.0173*), total cellulase (202 U/ml; p < 0.0001****), and xylanase (96.7 U/ml; p < 0.0001****) when compared with the readings of pure cultures. This hydrolytic activity resulted in the enhanced breakdown of wheat straw exhibiting a significant loss of 45.2% in lignin, 19.18% in cellulase, and 21.84% in hemicellulose contents. Furthermore, SEM and FTIR analysis of the co-culture treatments verified the improved biodegradation of wheat straw. Accumulatively, these results suggest a better approach for the effective use of dual-fungi for the lignocellulosic biomass breakdown and may have applications in bioethanol biorefineries using wheat straw as a sugar feedstock.

AB  - The enduring adoption of greener technologies from the biofuel manufacturing industries requires the balanced integration of multiple inter-disciplinary concerns (i.e., engineering, business, sustainability, societal) to make production processes more attractive to the industrial sector. From an engineering perspective, the commercial establishment of lignocellulosic bioethanol plants is still hindered by increased production cost. High product concentrations with improved yield and productivity at the fermentation stage seem to be inviolable condition to straightly compete with fossil-based and first-generation bioethanol facilities. This study proposes a model-based multi-objective dynamic optimization approach to systematically derive optimal operating policies for the fermentation bioreactor as a step forward towards enhancing the economic performance of lignocellulosic bioethanol plants. The economic benefit of the derived optimal bioreactor strategies is evaluated via a scalable economic index, linking for the first time the performance of the fermentation bioreactor to the economics of the entire production process. It is demonstrated that high values in productivity and substantial compromises in yield and final bioethanol concentration are conditions which favor economic feasibility with the achieved fermentation performance (3.32 g L−1 h−1, 0.399 g g−1, 106.0 g L−1) being comparable to first-generation bioethanol production. Finally, a global system analysis framework is employed to investigate the robustness of the optimal value of the economic index to the variability of key model parameters, illustrating the impact of model uncertainty on the process economic performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - India is an agrarian country producing a large amount of rice straw as an agricultural residue. These residues are burnt openly leading to severe environmental pollution and health hazards. Among several options available, anaerobic digestion of rice straw into biomethane gas and digestate is a promising technology. The current paper reviews the characteristics, principles of rice straw and the process variables (temperature, volatile fatty acids, and pH, carbon to nitrogen ratio, metal elements and organic loading rate) that affect the performance of the rice straw digestion and process strategies which may alleviate the barriers and may improve the biomethane yield. Co-digestion of rice straw with nitrogen-rich substrates is proven to be an effective way to balance the carbon to nitrogen ratio, in turn, leads to nutrient balance and enhance the biomethane yields of anaerobic co-digestion system. Moreover, pretreatment is another effective strategy; physical, chemical and biological pretreatments are reviewed in the article which improved the performance of digester. The utilisation of rice straw along with other co-substrates and appropriate pretreatment may be a recommended sustainable solution for preventing environmental and health hazards. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Global demand for fresh water is rising at a rapid rate and is struggling to keep pace with water requirements of increasing population. Against this scenario, the seafood industry including aquaculture routinely uses voluminous amounts of fresh water and discharges large volumes of post-process wastewater as effluents. The presence of proteins, oil, carotenoids, minerals, and other compounds in the effluents make them high in biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand, and hence, responsible for significant environmental hazards. Therefore, appropriate treatments of the effluents are essential before they are discharged or disposed off to mitigate the environmental problems. Besides, there are good potentials to recover various ingredients from the effluents for uses as food additives, nutraceuticals, nutritional supplements, flavoring agents, fertilizers, plant bio-stimulants, animal and aqua feed. Recent developments in microbial technology, particularly, algal biotechnology has potentials for cost-effective and eco-friendly treatments of the effluents together with the recovery of various biomolecules. Cultivation of microalgae in the effluents provide single cell proteins (SCP) that can have applications as animal feed including feed for the rising aquaculture industry. The SCP is also sources of proteins, oils, carotenoids and other compounds. The rich contents of oil in SCP can be resource for biofuel. In addition, the treated wastewaters can also be used as fertilizer. Recent developments in effluent treatments have potentials to improve water security, protect the environment, support food and nutraceutical industries, and enhance seafood sustainability, thereby contributing an interesting value chain for a circular bioeconomy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The interaction of xylan, an abundant plant polysaccharide, with cellulose microfibrils is essential for secondary cell wall strength. A deeper understanding of these interactions is crucial both to improve our understanding of plant cell wall architecture and to design alternate strategies to overcome cellulose recalcitrance for the production of biofuels and sustainable biomaterials. Naturally occurring acetate or glucuronic acid substitutions on xylan have been shown to influence xylan-cellulose interactions. Here, we use unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations to determine the interactions with the (110) hydrophilic face of cellulose fibers of four different xylans. In the absence of cellulose, all xylans, independent of the substitution pattern, adopt a highly flexible threefold helical screw conformation. However, when xylan is spatially close to a cellulose surface 1,2 linked acetyl xylans (2AcX) adopt rigid twofold helical screw conformations. The 2AcX conformations are primarily stabilized by interactions between the acetylated oxygen and the glycosidic linkage with C-O6 of cellulose. In contrast, the glycosidic oxygens and acetyl decorations for 1,3 linked acetyl groups (3AcX) are oriented away from the cellulose surface and the 3AcX xylans maintain threefold helical screw conformations on the cellulose surface. Our results show that evenly spaced chemical functionalization (with acetyl groups) and the position of substitution (1,2) on xylan backbone play key roles in tuning the xylan-cellulose interactions to stabilize the twofold helical screw conformations of xylan on the cellulose surface. A comparison with previous experimental findings further suggests that 1,2 substitutions induce twofold helical screw conformations of xylan on the cellulose surface irrespective of the chemical nature of the substituent, while 1,3 substitutions primarily bind lignin in threefold helical screw conformations rather than cellulose in plant cell walls. © 2021, UT-Battelle, LLC, under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Pretreatment plays a key role in biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, the main factors of peroxyformic acid (PA) pretreatment were optimized in the light of enzymolysis efficiency and composition analysis of pretreated sugarcane bagasse (SCB). Lignin was significantly removed (59.0%) and a complete saccharification level (103.6%) was obtained for the pretreated SCB with slight cellulose loss (9.2%) under the optimized pretreatment conditions. The effects of PA pretreatment on the structural characteristics of SCB were also studied and the digestibility of pretreated SCB was also evaluated by dark fermentative hydrogen production with an enriched anaerobic cellulolytic microbial consortium MC1. The hydrogen production increased by 195.5% (based on initial SCB) and the abundance of dominant hemicellulose-degradation genus Thermoanaerobacterium increased from 23.8% to 40.2% due to the remaining and accessible hemicellulose in PA pretreated SCB. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The mass transfer limitation of biopretreatment (BAC) of rice straw biomass can be improved by a delignification process prior to BAC for energy efficient biomethane recovery. In the present study, rice straw biomass was subjected to delignification by ultrasonic homogenization. As a result, a higher lignin removal efficiency of 70.28% was achieved at an optimal biomass to water medium ratio of 0.02 (w/v) and a specific energy input of 450 kJ per kg TS. Delignification can increase the accessibility of cellulose present in the rice straw to biopretreatment. The delignified and biopretreated rice straw (Delign-BAC) sample was more efficient with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization of 35% than BAC with 21% solubilization and the control (untreated sample) with 3.2% solubilization. The lignin content of the Delign-BAC sample was 0.3 g L−1and it did not lead to the inhibition of methanogenesis with a specific methane production of 165.5 mL per g VS. Economic analysis exposed that Delign-BAC gained a profitable net profit (68.62 USD per ton) with a cost benefit ratio (1.23) higher than that of BAC (−22.912 USD ton and 0.62). © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - The availability of fossil fuels is a major factor that determines the economy of a country. However, possible exhaustion of fossil fuel deposits as well as increased pollution, and other adverse effects on the environment has prompted us to search for alternative fuels. This resulted in the development of hythane, a blend of hydrogen with methane, at concentrations of 10%–30%. The breakdown of organic substrates using sequential dark fermentation (DF) and anaerobic digestion (AD) leads to biohythane production. The quality and quantity of biohythane can be improved by altering the following aspects: selection, development, and/or genetic engineering of suitable microbial consortium; the use of cheap, appropriate substrates; improved design of bioreactors; and the implementation of two-stage fermentation system. This review focusses on the mechanism of biohythane production and the different aspects involved in increasing both its production rate and quality. A comparative study has also been done to demonstrate the superiority of biohythane over other biofuels. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The plant cell wall is the most abundant carbon reservoir in nature and is a renewable source of biofuels. To break down this biomass and convert it into fermentable sugars, a set of multiple enzymes is needed. Here, we characterize the enzymatic repertoire necessary for the degradation of sugarcane bagasse “in natura” and pre-treated using Aspergillus clavatus as a model. 135 unique peptides were identified by Mass Spectrometry MS/MS. 23 of these proteins belong to classes of enzymes involved in biomass degradation and were differentially expressed on various substrates. Each pretreatment changed the sugarcane bagasse composition, which, in turn, led to the differential expression of A. clavatus holocellulases. The deconstruction of “in natura” bagasse demanded the largest set of enzymes due to the structural complexity of this material. Not only different sources of biomass but also different pretreatments of the same source will determine the enzymes required for the most efficient biomass conversion, avoiding the use of non-essential enzymes and consequent financial expense. Understanding A. clavatus nutritional strategies by proteomic analysis of secretome can improve the technology applied to biomass conversion and by-product synthesis. © 2020

AB  - The main purpose of the paper is to find the sustainable solutions for crop residues burning in the northwestern states of India. Pre- and post-monsoon burning of the crop residues in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and western Uttar Pradesh increases the particulate matter significantly in the environment. During this period, the wind remains stagnant in Delhi NCR (National Capital Region) which creates an airlock situation in this region. The air quality during this period becomes very poor. It is a major health issue in the northern part of the country, especially in NCR Delhi which is densely populated and industrialized. It has become a major concern for the state as well as central government. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review the factors forcing the farmers to burn the crop residues in the field and analyze the solutions considering the social and economic sustainability of the farmers. A focus group discussion composed of farmers, academicians, and industry experts has been used to get the opinion regarding the solutions for crop residues burning in the field. For an analysis of the information collected, a hybrid approach of analytic hierarchy process and elimination and choice expressing reality have been used. Based on the analysis, it is observed that use of crop residues for the preparation of biogas, biochar, and bioethanol is the most preferred substitute, whereas use as fuel for the thermal power plant is the second preferred substitute for use of crop residues. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - As representative among biomass feedstocks, Poplar fluff was chosen to analyze the pyrolysis properties of this new biofuel. Thermogravimetry under inert (argon) atmosphere at the heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C min−1 was employed in the investigation of thermal processing of studied biomass. The determination of kinetic parameters and estimation of reaction mechanism function were done through application of the state-of-the-art NETZSCH Kinetics NEO software. With this aim, the various model-free models and model-based calculations were implemented. The obtained results showed that the most appropriate kinetic model to describe the thermal decomposition of Poplar fluff sample was n-dimensional acceleratory Avrami–Erofeev model (An) for three-step consecutive reaction mechanism. Governed reaction pathway in pyrolysis process represents fragmentation reactions which arise from levoglucosan decomposing that permits permanent gases and refractory tars, where diffusion-controlled process is involved in the sample devolatilization. The modulated and multiple-step predictions of pyrolysis process were also carried out. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Thermomyces lanuginose lipase (TLL) were co-immobilized on epoxy functionalized silica gel via an isocyanide-based multicomponent reaction. The immobilization process was carried out in water (pH 7) at 25 °C, rapidly (3 h) resulting in high immobilization yields (100%) with a loading of 10 mg enzyme/g support. The immobilized preparations were used to produce biodiesel by transesterification of palm oil. In an optimization study, response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite rotatable design (CCRD) methods were used to study the effect of five independent factors including temperature, methanol to oil ratio, t-butanol concentration and CALB:TLL ratio on the yield of biodiesel production. The optimum combinations for the reaction were CALB:TLL ratio (2.1:1), t-butanol (45 wt%), temperature (47 °C), methanol: oil ratio (2.3). This resulted in a FAME yield of 94%, very close to the predicted value of 98%. © 2020

AB  - Yak dung is used as fuel in Tibetan homes; however, this use is hazardous to health. An alternative use of the dung that would be profitable and offset the loss as a fuel would be very beneficial. Sweet sorghum silage with yak dung biochar as an additive was compared with a control silage with no additives and three silages with different commercial additives, namely Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum and Acremonium cellulase. Biochar-treated silage had a significantly greater concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates than the other silages (76 vs 12.4–45.8 g/kg DM) and a greater crude protein content (75.5 vs 61.4 g/kg DM), lactic acid concentration (40.7 vs 27.7 g/kg DM) and gross energy yield (17.8 vs 17.4 MJ/kg) than the control silage. Biochar-treated and control silages did not differ in in vitro digestibility and in total gas (507 vs 511 L/kg DM) and methane production (57.9 vs 57.1 L/kg DM). Biochar inhibited degradation of protein and water-soluble carbohydrates and enhanced lactic acid production, which improved storability of feed. It was concluded that yak dung biochar is an efficient, cost-effective ensiling additive. The profit could offset the loss of dung as fuel and improve the health of Tibetan people. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Second-generation biofuel crop miscanthus is one of the most promising plants tested for phytomanagement of contaminated sites. In this preliminary pot case study, the most used hybrid Miscanthus x giganteus was cultivated in three different real contaminated soils: agricultural soil contaminated with Cd; post-military soil slightly contaminated with Zn, Pb and Cd; and soil contaminated by petroleum industry with metals and hydrocarbons. The stress response of plants and soil microbial communities was monitored to receive data that are important for successful phytomanagement application. With metals only, the plant grew well, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurement proved their good vitality. Changes in leaf anatomy (leaf thickness and sclerenchyma cells area) were additionally determined in post-military soil compared to agricultural. On the contrary, in petroleum-contaminated soil, the biomass yield was too reduced and also physiological parameters were significantly decreased. The response of microbial communities also differed. In agricultural soil, no microbial stress was determined. In post-military soil, it became reduced during the experiment, and in petroleum contamination, it increased year-on-year. It could be concluded that miscanthus is suitable for cultivation in metals contaminated soils with potential for microbial communities support, but in soil contaminated by the petroleum industry, its application did not seem meaningful. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Abstract: Yarrowia lipolytica strain is a promising cell factory for the conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels and bioproducts. Despite the inherent robustness of this strain, further improvements to lignocellulose-derived inhibitors toxicity tolerance of Y. lipolytica are also required to achieve industrial application. Here, adaptive laboratory evolution was employed with increasing concentrations of ferulic acid. The adaptive laboratory evolution experiments led to evolve Y. lipolytica strain yl-XYL + *FA*4 with increased tolerance to ferulic acid as compared to the parental strain. Specifically, the evolved strain could tolerate 1.5 g/L ferulic acid, whereas 0.5 g/L ferulic acid could cause about 90% lethality of the parental strain. Transcriptome analysis of the evolved strain revealed several targets underlying toxicity tolerance enhancements. YALI0_E25201g, YALI0_F05984g, YALI0_B18854g, and YALI0_F16731g were among the highest upregulated genes, and the beneficial contributions of these genes were verified via reverse engineering. Recombinant strains with overexpressing each of these four genes obtained enhanced tolerance to ferulic acid as compared to the control strain. Fortunately, recombinant strains with overexpression of YALI0_E25201g, YALI0_B18854g, and YALI0_F16731g individually also obtained enhanced tolerance to vanillic acid. Overall, this work demonstrated a whole strain improvement cycle by “non-rational” metabolic engineering and presented new targets to modify Y. lipolytica for microbial lignocellulose valorization. Key points: • Adaptive evolution improved the ferulic acid tolerance of Yarrowia lipolytica • Transcriptome sequence was applied to analyze the ferulic acid tolerate strain • Three genes were demonstrated for both ferulic acid and vanillic acid tolerance © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Woody plants provide enormous biomass resource convertible for biofuels and bioproducts, but they are of typical lignified secondary cell walls with strong recalcitrance against biomass degradation. It thus becomes critical to find out the desirable woody plant enabled for efficient biomass enzymatic saccharification. In this study, we collected totally seven biomass samples from three major hardwood species showing worldwide geographic distributions and diverse cell wall compositions. Under acid (H2SO4) and alkali (NaOH, CaO) pretreatments, all biomass samples showed remarkably enhanced enzymatic saccharification, but the Populus simonii species had the highest hexoses yields from all pretreatments performed. In particular, the mild and green-like pretreatment (10% CaO, 50°C) could lead to more than 70% cellulose degradation into fermentable hexoses in the P. simonii species, but only 24%–38% cellulose digestions were examined in the other six samples. Importantly, the P. simonii species is of the lowest ratios of lignin S/G and hemicellulose Xyl/Ara among seven samples, being two major factors accountable for much improved lignocellulose recalcitrance. These consequently caused the most reduced cellulose DP in the pretreated P. simonii residues for enhanced biomass saccharification. Furthermore, this study performed a genome-wide profiling of gene expression to confirm distinct wall polymer biosynthesis and biomass metabolism in the P. simonii species, consistent with its significantly improved lignocellulose recalcitrance. Therefore, this study has found out the desirable model of woody plants for efficient biomass enzymatic saccharification under cost-effective and green-like pretreatments, providing a powerful strategy for genetic lignocellulose modification in woody plants and beyond. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Due to the damaging environmental impacts resulting from direct entry of mineral lubricants into the environment, the use of bio-lubricants as a sustainable and renewable alternative to mineral lubricants is necessary; therefore, bio-based lubricants play an important role in overcoming existing challenges and reducing energy consumption. The present research has been conducted to intensity the production process of TMPTE (trimethylolpropane triester) from rapeseed methyl ester under the influence of ultrasonic irradiation. Ultrasound irradiation is one of the efficient and new methods to intensify the TMPTE production reaction. Ultrasound significantly intensifies the overall process with reduction in energy consumption. The response surface methodology was used for the multi-objective optimization of the process input variables in order to obtain the highest yield with the lowest energy consumption. The optimized results of this experiment reveal that with the amplitude of 82%, cycle of 40%, and reaction time of 60 min a bio-lubricant yield of 82.21% with an energy consumption of 116.7 kJ is obtained. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, valorisation pathways of brewers’ spent grains (BSG) towards biofuels production under the biorefinery concept were studied utilizing experimental data that provide a common base for straightforward comparison. The dehydration and the recovery of used oil, bioethanol and biogas from BSG were studied. The process units involved were thoroughly investigated and optimized. The oil extraction efficiency reached up to 70% using solid-liquid extraction process with hexane as solvent. The optimal ethanol yield achieved was 45% after the application of acid pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis with CellicCTec2 and fermentation with S. Cerevisiae. As far as biogas potential is concerned, the raw BSG, defatted BSG and stillage presented values equal to 379 ± 19, 235 ± 21 and 168 ± 39 mL biogas/g for respectively. Through the combination of the proposed schemes, three biorefinery scenarios were set up able to produce biodiesel, bioethanol and/or biogas. Material flow diagrams were set up in order to assess these schemes. Given that BSG could ensure ‘green’ energy production in the range of 4.5–7.0 million MJ/y if the European BSG potential is fully valorised, BSG could substantially contribute to the biofuel energy strategy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial pretreatments have been identified as a compatible and sustainable process with anaerobic digestion compared to energy-intensive physicochemical pretreatments. In this study, barley straw and hay co-substrate was pretreated with a microaerobic barley straw-adapted microbial (BSAM) consortium prior to anaerobic digestion. The improved digestibility was investigated through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, microbial counts and C:N ratios. BSAM pretreatment resulted in 15.2 L kg−1 TS of methane yield after 35 days, almost 40 times more than the control. The methane content in total biogas produced were 58% (v/v) and 10% (v/v) in BSAM and control, respectively. This research demonstrated that BSAM-based pretreatment significantly increased the digestibility and surface area of the lignocellulosic material and considerably enhanced biomethanation. This study generates new potential bio-research opportunities in the emerging field of lignocellulosic anaerobic digestion-biorefineries. © 2020

AB  - Lignocellulosic waste has offered a cost-effective and food security-wise substrate for the generation of biofuels and value-added products. Here, whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analyses were performed for Serratia sp. AXJ-M. The results showed that strain AXJ-M contained a high proportion of strain-specific genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, the genetic basis of strain AXJ-M for efficient degradation of cellulose was identified. Cellulase activity tests revealed strong cellulose degradation ability and cellulase activities in strain AXJ-M. mRNA expression indicated that GH1, GH3 and GH8 might determine the strain's cellulose degradation ability. The SWISS-MODEL and Ramachandran Plot were used to predict and evaluate the 3D structure, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) were used to analyze the cellulose degradation products. Further research is needed to elucidate the cellulose degradation mechanism and to develop industrial applications for lignocellulosic biomass degradation and waste management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Saccharification of sugarcane bagasse is one of the most important process for its conversion to high value biofuels and chemicals. In the present work, a sustainable hydrolysis method combined with catalytic pretreatment by magnetic carbon-based solid acid and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis were applied for the enhanced reducing sugar (xylose and glucose) production from sugarcane bagasse. The pretreatment condition was optimized via response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design. Under optimized conditions (the ratio of sugarcane bagasse, catalyst and water is 1:1:25 (g:g:mL), 170 °C for 10 min), the highest xylose yield of 91.62 % was achieved for 10 min. The enzymatic digestibility of the pretreated sugarcane bagasse under the optimum condition was reached up to 94.26 % at 72 h under the enzyme loading of 20 FPU/g, which is much higher than that of natural sugarcane bagasse. Meanwhile, FTIR, XRD and SEM were used to characterize the effects of the pretreatment process. Overall, this study provides a greener and high-efficiency method for saccharifying sugarcane bagasse to produce reducing sugars. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - When coupling wastewater treatment and biofuel production, bacteria inevitably compete with microalgae for nutrients and habitat resources. Yet, microalgae utilize symbiotic relationships to mediate adverse effects in unfavorable environments. We hypothesized microalgal co-culture strategy could be a feasible approach to resist the quorum-sensing molecule stress from bacteria. Here, we used two model microalgae taxa, Chlorella and Scenedesmus, to compare cell growth and lipid production in mono- and co-culture conditions under the stress of a representative bacterial signal, C6-HSL. Co-culture cultivation reduced growth inhibition (by 50 % for Chlorella and 35 % for Scenedesmus) induced by C6-HSL. Antioxidant enzymes and mitochondrial activities were inhibited by C6-HSL stress in monoculture, but they were negligibly affected using the co-culture strategy. The maximum lipid productivity and production of the co-culture system were 0.12 g/(L d) and 0.71 g/L, respectively, and lipid production was 20–79 % higher than that of Chlorella and Scenedesmus monocultures. We found that the co-culture strategy could efficiently limit bacterial-induced competition stress and thus improve microalgae lipid production. © 2020

AB  - CO2 fermentation is a promising process to produce biofuels like ethanol. It can be integrated in third generation biofuel production processes to substitute traditional sugar fermentation when supplied with cheap electron donors, e.g. hydrogen derived from wind energy or as surplus gas in electrolysis. In this study, granular sludge from an industrial wastewater treatment plant was tested as inoculum for ethanol production from H2/CO2 via non-phototropic fermentation at submesophilic (25 °C), mesophilic (37 °C) and thermophilic (55 °C) conditions. The highest ethanol concentration (17.11 mM) was obtained at 25 °C and was 5-fold higher than at 37 °C (3.36 mM), which was attributed to the fact that the undissociated acid (non-ionized acetic acid) accumulation rate constant (0.145 h−1) was 1.39 fold higher than at 25 °C (0.104 h−1). Methane was mainly produced at 55 °C, while neither acetic acid nor ethanol were formed. Ethanol production was linked to acetic acid production with the highest ethanol to acetic acid ratio of 0.514 at 25 °C. The carbon recovery was 115.7%, 131.2% and 117.1%, while the electron balance was almost closed (97.1%, 110.1% and 109.1%) at 25 °C, 37 °C and 55 °C, respectively. The addition of bicarbonate inhibited ethanol production both at 25 °C and 37 °C. Clostridium sp. were the prevalent species at both 25 and 37 °C at the end of the incubation, which possibly contributed to the ethanol production. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Microalgae accumulate lipid triacylglycerol (TAG), a promising feedstock for production of natural edible oils and biofuels. To make products derived from microalgal TAG economically viable, increasing TAG content and productivity are of high importance. To increase TAG content, two endogenous key enzymes of TAG biosynthesis: plastidial lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (NeoLPAAT1) and endoplasmic reticulum-located diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (NeoDGAT2) were co-overexpressed in oleaginous microalga Neochloris oleoabundans. The neutral lipid content in NeoLPAAT1-NeoDGAT2 co-overexpressing transformant detected by Nile red staining increased 2-fold without compromising cell growth. The transcriptional levels of NeoLPAAT1 and NeoDGAT2 levels were 1.9-fold higher in the transformant than wild type. Considerably higher lipid accumulation was found in the transformant than wild type: total lipid content (73.72 ± 4.17 % DCW) increased 1.6-fold, TAG content (50.63 ± 6.15 % DCW) increased 2.1-fold, total lipid productivity (16.84 ± 0.66 mg/L/day) increased 1.9-fold, and TAG productivity (11.68 ± 0.90 mg/L/day) increased 2.1-fold. Fatty acid composition was slightly altered in the transformant compared to wild type; saturated fatty acid C16:0 increased to 26% from 20%, whereas C18:0 was reduced to 7% from 14%. Long-term stability of NeoLPAAT1-NeoDGAT2 co-overexpression was observed in the transformant continuously maintained on solid medium in a period of 4 years. The results suggested that targeted engineering of genes in pathway located at different organelles should be possible in microalgal lipid metabolism. © 2020 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - In this work, hydrothermal treatment was assessed for the fractionation of industrial Eucalyptus globulus bark residue (EBR) to obtain biofuels and value-added compounds (such as oligosaccharides and phenolic compounds) in separated streams. Hydrothermal treatment was evaluated under non-isothermal regimen in the range of maximum temperature (Tmax) of 177–228 °C or severities (S0) between 2.76 and 4.25. The highest oligosaccharides concentration (17.5 g/L) was achieved at S0 of 3.69, corresponding to hemicellulose recovery of 77.30%. Under all severities evaluated in this work, over 90.94% and 84.17% of cellulose and lignin remained in the solid phase, respectively. The increase of S0 improved 4.38-fold the enzymatic saccharification of cellulose, the highest glucose yield (84%) being achieved at S0 of 4.04. Considering the maximal recovery of polysaccharides as glucose and oligosaccharides from the liquid and solid phases, S0 of 4.04 was selected for bioethanol production using high solid loadings and following different strategies (simultaneous saccharification and fermentation – SSF and pre-saccharification and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation – PSSF). The utilization of 15% hydrothermally pretreated EBR without nutrient supplementation resulted in 26 g/L of ethanol, independently of the strategy used. An increase up to 17.5% solids and employing nutrient supplementation enabled the production of 38 g/L (or 4.8% v/v) of ethanol by PSSF. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Valorization of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels has received considerable attention for decades with tremendous thermochemical pretreatments proposed. However, inconsistencies among studies in lignin removal can often be misleading and even violate the chemical mechanism, which might be attributed to the variation in the filtration method used after pretreatment. A phenomenon, promoting pretreatment strategies based on sugar conversion efficiency or yield only from single and random low-solid enzymatic hydrolysis, was also observed. Herein, the effects of filtration methods using a slow drip metal filter (SDMF) with an aperture of 0.2 mm and Whatman grade 4 filter paper (WGFP) with an aperture of 20-25 μm under vacuum filtration after liquid hot water (LHW), acid, and alkali pretreatments on the chemical composition of the solid and liquid, sugar recoveries, and lignin removal and solid loading (2-15%) on enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover and poplar wood were investigated. Results showed that SDMF increased the glucan content (1.1-3.0%) in pretreated biomass and induced solid loss (3.8-12.6%) into the filtrates, resulting in lower sugar recoveries and overestimated lignin removal compared to WGFP. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural derived from sugar degradation triggered pseudolignin formation, inducing a negative lignin removal for both LHW and acid pretreated biomass. In comparison, alkali pretreatment neutralized the weak acids released from sugar decomposition and achieved a robust delignification (67.8-90.8%). Solid loading used for enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass determined sugar concentration, conversion efficiency, and yield. This result indicates that promoting pretreatment technologies based on sugar conversion efficiency or yield of enzymatic hydrolysis at low solid loading may be misleading. This work demonstrates that the filtration method used for solid and liquid separations after pretreatment and solid loading for enzymatic hydrolysis should be cautiously selected and implemented when valorizing biomass into biofuels. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Enzyme immobilization on solid conducting surfaces faces challenges for practical applications in technologies such as biosensors and biofuel cells. Short-term stability, poor electrochemical performance, and enzyme inhibition are some unsolved issues. Here, we show a simple methodology for bilirubin oxidase (BOD) immobilization on carbon-based gas diffusion electrode for four-electron electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction. BOD is incorporated into a Nafion® matrix and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde by a one-pot reaction in buffered solution, producing a stable BOD-based biogel. The biogel provides stable electrode performance and allows the direct electron-transfer mechanism of multicopper centers buried in the enzyme. A biocatalytic reduction current of −1.52 ± 0.24 mA cm−2 at 0.19 ± 0.06 V was observed under gas diffusion conditions. Additionally, the bioelectrode showed unprecedented long-term stability under continuous operation combined with satisfactory catalytic current without redox mediator. The BOD-based biogel layer thickness and the entrapment of BOD into Nafion network are crucial for the biocathode stability, and BOD crosslinking by glutaraldehyde contributes to enhance the catalytic currents. Further, the BOD-based biogel provides a suitable microenvironment for long-term enzymatic activity involving three-phase interfacial reaction. The present study provides new insights into enzyme immobilization to overcome the critical short-term stability of enzyme-based electrochemical devices for practical applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - α-Pinene, an important biologically active natural monoterpene, has been widely used in fragrances, medicines, and fine chemicals, especially, in high-density renewable fuels such as jet fuel. The development of an α-pinene production platform in a highly modifiable microbe from renewable substitute feedstocks could lead to a green, economical avenue, and sustainable biotechnological process for the biosynthesis of α-pinene. Here, we report engineering of an orthogonal biosynthetic pathway for efficient production of α-pinene in oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica that resulted in an α-pinene titer of 19.6 mg/L when using glucose as the sole carbon source, a significant 218-fold improvement than the initial titer. In addition, the potential of using waste cooking oil and lignocellulosic hydrolysate as carbon sources for α-pinene production from the engineered Y. lipolytica strains was analyzed. The results indicated that α-pinene titers of 33.8 and 36.1 mg/L were successfully obtained in waste cooking oil and lignocellulosic hydrolysate medium, thereby representing the highest titer reported to date in yeast. To our knowledge, this is also the first report related to microbial production of α-pinene from waste cooking oil and lignocellulosic hydrolysate. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biofuel cells allow for constructing sensors that leverage the specificity of enzymes without the need for an external power source. In this work, we design a self-powered glucose sensor based on a biofuel cell. The redox enzymes glucose dehydrogenase (NAD-GDH), glucose oxidase (GOx), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were immobilized as biocatalysts on the electrodes, which were previously engineered using carbon nanostructures, including multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Additional polymers were also introduced to improve biocatalyst immobilization. The reported design offers three main advantages: (i) by using glucose as the substrate for the both anode and cathode, a more compact and robust design is enabled, (ii) the system operates under air-saturating conditions, with no need for gas purge, and (iii) the combination of carbon nanostructures and a multi-enzyme cascade maximizes the sensitivity of the biosensor. Our design allows the reliable detection of glucose in the range of 0.1-7.0 mM, which is perfectly suited for common biofluids and industrial food samples.

AB  - Algae is considered as a promising third-generation biofuel feedstock. Macroalgae is an efficient source of biomass for biohydrogen production. Biohydrogen (H2) is believed as a sustainable and clean energy carrier with high-energy yield. The pretreatment is essential to enhance the hydrolytic process during dark fermentation. During pretreatment, some inhibitory substances are formed and are controlled by detoxification techniques. This review briefly covers the marine macroalgal species, pretreatment methods for biohydrogen production, and inhibitory components formed during the pretreatment. Lastly, this review suggests the techno economic assessment about life cycle, energy, and economic feasibility in biohydrogen production from macroalgae. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide in lignocellulosic biomass, where it is interlinked with lignin and hemicellulose. Bioethanol can be produced from biomass. Since breaking down biomass is difficult, cellulose‐active enzymes secreted by filamentous fungi play an important role in degrading recalcitrant lignocellulosic biomass. We characterized a cellobiohydrolase (AfCel6A) and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase LPMO (AfAA9_B) from Aspergillus fumigatus after they were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified. The biochemical parameters suggested that the enzymes were stable; the optimal temperature was ~60 °C. Further characterization revealed high turnover numbers (kcat of 147.9 s−1 and 0.64 s−1, respectively). Surprisingly, when combined, AfCel6A and AfAA9_B did not act synergistically. AfCel6A and AfAA9_B association inhibited AfCel6A activity, an outcome that needs to be further investigated. However, AfCel6A or AfAA9_B addition boosted the enzymatic saccharification activity of a cellulase cocktail and the activity of cellulase Af‐EGL7. Enzymatic cocktail supplementation with AfCel6A or AfAA9_B boosted the yield of fermentable sugars from complex substrates, especially sugarcane exploded bagasse, by up to 95%. The synergism between the cellulase cocktail and AfAA9_B was enzyme‐ and substratespecific, which suggests a specific enzymatic cocktail for each biomass by up to 95%. The synergism between the cellulase cocktail and AfAA9_B was enzyme‐ and substrate‐specific, which suggests a specific enzymatic cocktail for each biomass. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The main concern of lignocellulosic biomass utilization for biofuel production is the presence of lignin which hinder the hemicellulose and cellulose accessibility. In this study, chemical and biological pretreatments have been used for decomposition of the lignocellulosic cotton stalk (CS) into monosaccharides. Long-term fermentation/co-fermentation (upto 5 cycles) of pretreated CS by immobilized yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPH499 and Pachysolen tannophilus 32691) for bioethanol was investigated. Spectroscopic analysis (including FTIR, XRD, SEM, and TGA) showed the disintegration and abrasion in CS structure after application of both the pretreatments. The maximum sugar utilization efficiency in 1st cycle of co-fermentation by immobilized yeasts was 94.1 and 90.4% with 0.46 and 0.44 g/g bioethanol production in chemical and biological pretreatment, respectively. Moreover, bioethanol yield was slightly sustained till 2nd cycle (0.38−0.40 g/g). However, bioethanol production steadily declined at 3rd cycle and reached to the lowest value at 5th cycle. These results demonstrated that co-fermentation with immobilization approach might significantly improve the bioethanol production from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass (including CS). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plant leaves harbor complex microbial communities that influence plant health and productivity. Nevertheless, a detailed understanding of phyllosphere community assembly and drivers is needed, particularly for phyllosphere fungi. Here, we investigated seasonal dynamics of epiphytic phyllosphere fungal communities in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a focal bioenergy crop. We also leverage previously published data on switchgrass phyllosphere bacterial communities from the same experimental plants, allowing us to compare fungal and bacterial dynamics and explore interdomain network associations in the switchgrass phyllosphere. Overall, we found a strong impact of sampling date on fungal community composition, with multiple taxonomic levels exhibiting clear temporal patterns in relative abundance. In addition, leaf nitrogen concentration, leaf dry matter content, plant height, and minimum daily air temperature explained significant variation in phyllosphere fungal communities, likely due to their correlation with sampling date. Finally, among the core taxa, fungi-bacteria network associations were much more common than bacteria-bacteria associations, suggesting the importance of interdomain phylogenetic diversity in microbiome assembly. Although our findings highlight the complexity of phyllosphere microbiome assembly, the clear temporal patterns in lineagespecific fungal abundances give promise to the potential for accurately predicting shifts in fungal phyllosphere communities throughout the growing season, a key research priority for sustainable agriculture. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of yard waste (YW) and food waste (FW) was performed in landfill leachate (LL) to overcome the unnecessary exploitation of our limited natural resources. The physicochemical properties and combustion behavior of the resulting hydrochars were compared with those obtained using distilled water (DW) as reaction medium. Although performing HTC in LL led to lower hydrochar mass yields (43% YWH and 36% FWH) than DW (47.1% YWH and 41.5% FWH), it had minimal impact on the fuel characteristics of the hydrochars. Notably, the higher heating value of the hydrochars prepared in LL (22.8 MJ kg−1 for YWH and 30.2 MJ kg−1 for FWH) is comparable to that of conventional solid fuels, and may, therefore, be considered as inexpensive alternatives to fossil fuels. Overall, the results of this study conclusively suggest that the use of LL as an alternative moisture source can significantly improve the sustainability of HTC technology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is urgent the transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to a sustainable bioeconomy based on bioconversion technologies using renewable plant biomass feedstocks to produce high chemicals, bioplastics, and biofuels. β-Glucosidases are key enzymes responsible for degrading the plant cell wall polymers, as they cleave glucan-based oligo- and polysaccharides to generate glucose. Monosaccharide-tolerant or -stimulated β-glucosidases have been reported in the past decade. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of β-glucosidase stimulation by glucose and xylose. The glycoside hydrolase 1 family β-glucosidase from Thermotoga petrophila (TpBgl1) displays a typical glucose stimulation mechanism based on an increased Vmax and decreased Km in response to glucose. Through molecular docking and dynamics analyses, we mapped putative monosaccharide binding regions (BRs) on the surface of TpBgl1. Our results indicate that after interaction with glucose or xylose at BR1 site, an adjacent loop region assumes an extended conformation, which increases the entrance to the TpBgl1 active site, improving product formation. Biochemical assays with TpBgl1 BR1 mutants, TpBgl1D49A/Y410A and TpBgl1D49K/Y410H, resulted in decreasing and abolishing monosaccharide stimulation, respectively. These mutations also impaired the BR1 looping extension responsible for monosaccharide stimulation. This study provides a molecular basis for the rational design of β-glucosidases for biotechnological applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The integral valorization of potential sugars (cellulosic and hemicellulosic) from spent coffee grounds (SCG), a lignocellulosic residue, is proposed in this work. With this aim, the microwave assisted dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment has been optimized, leading to a hemicellulosic sugar recovery in the pretreatment liquid (HSRL) and an enzymatic hydrolysis yield of 79 and 98%, respectively, at 160.47 °C and 1.5% H2SO4. Moreover, the complete digestibility of cellulose (enzymatic hydrolysis yield = 100%) was also discovered for non-pretreated SCG, which is very interesting. Secondly, the production of biobutanol, an advanced biofuel, is also proposed from pretreated SCG enzymatic hydrolysate and pretreatment liquid achieved under optimal conditions. These were fermented by Clostridium beijerinckii, yielding 95 kg butanol/t SCG (dry matter) and 151 kg acetone-butanol-ethanol/t SCG (dry matter). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in energy demand, especially in Jordan, has encouraged researchers to consider alternative sources of energy, such as biofuel production from agricultural waste. For this study, Jordanian corn leaf waste was characterized by ultimate and proximate analysis, TGA, FTIR and solid state 13C NMR. The waste showed high volatile matter, high atomic H/C ratio and high O content. The corn leaf waste contained 32.1 wt% cellulose, 18.1 wt% hemicelluloses and 11.9 wt% lignin. The FTIR and 13C NMR spectrums showed high concentrations of aliphatic and carbonyl carbon. The corn leaf waste was pyrolysed in a temperature range of 300–450 °C under a constant flow rate of nitrogen. Higher oil yield was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C. The gas yield and higher heating value of the product increased as the temperature increased, whereas the water content decreased. The biofuels were rich in carbon and had a high oxygen content, which decreased as the temperature increased. The 1H NMR confirmed the markedly aliphatic character of the biofuel. The GC-MS for the biofuel indicated the presence of hydrocarbon series, large amounts of oxygenated compounds and a few nitrogen and sulfur compounds. The simulated distillation showed a high proportion of diesel fraction (57–73%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer present on Earth in the form of agriculture waste. Hydrolysis of agriculture waste for simple fermentable reducing sugars is the bottleneck in the area of biofuel generation and other value-added products. The present study aims to utilize the camel rumen as a bioreactor for potent cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria by altering the feed types with varying cellulosic concentrations. A total of 6716 bacterial cultures were subjected to three layers of screening, where plate zymography and chromophoric substrate screening served as primary screening method for cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic potential. The potential isolates were genetically grouped using RAPD, and 51 representative isolates from each group were subjected to molecular identification through 16S rDNA sequencing, followed by quantification of various cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes. Out of 51 potent isolates, 5 isolates had high endoglucanase activity ranging from 0.3 to 0.48 U/ml. The selected five key isolates identified as Pseudomonas, Paenibacillus, Citrobacter, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter were employed for hydrolyzing the various agriculture residues and resulted in approximately 0.4 mg/ml of reducing sugar. Furthermore, the metaculturomics approach was implemented to deduce the total cultured diversity through 16S rRNA amplicon library sequencing. The metaculturomics data revealed the dominance of proteobacteria and unidentified bacterial population in all four feed types, which indicates the possibility of culturing novel cellulose-deconstructing bacteria. Moreover, the presence of diverse hydrolytic enzymes in cultured isolates supports the usage of these bacteria in bio-processing of agriculture waste residues and obtaining the biofuels and other value-added products. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Abstract: In this study, we have investigated the application of the non-precious β-PbO2/MWNTs nanocomposites, which were developed via a simple wet-chemistry procedure, toward electrochemical oxidation of lignin. Structural characterization of the synthesized electrocatalysts was performed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and BET surface area analysis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometry (ChA) measurements were carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of different electrocatalysts toward lignin oxidation. The 33.3 wt% β-PbO2 nanocomposite possessed the highest electro-catalytic activity and stability for depolymerization of lignin. Several oxidation products such as vanillin and methyl salicylate were also identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GS-MS) analysis. The enhanced electrochemical surfaces areas of the low-cost β-PbO2/MWNTs electrocatalyst combined with its good stabilities offer a promising route for developing an energy-efficient lignin depolymerization process.

AB  - Plant-based biofuels are globally accepted renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. Both biodiesel and bioethanol can be derived from various plant-based feedstocks using conventional and advanced conversion technologies. However, the use of conventional first-generation plant feedstocks creates a ‘food versus fuel’ conflict through competition with agriculture for arable land and freshwater resources. In this regard, succulent, latex-yielding species of Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae) have advantages as feedstock for liquid biofuel production. These include high levels of primary productivity, a remarkable ability to grow on marginal lands under xeric conditions, and a relatively small bioenergy freshwater footprint. In addition, yields of Euphorbia-based biofuels are relatively high, and the fuel has chemical, physical, and combustive properties that are comparable to or exceed those of fossil fuels. In this review, we summarize the status of biofuel research using Euphorbia feedstock. Harvesting and drying of biomass, extraction, characterization and refinement of biocrude, blending with diesel, fuel properties, effects on engine performance and emissions, and use of spent residues for production of bioethanol and other valuable co-products are discussed. Major challenges and future opportunities associated with Euphorbia-based biofuel development are considered. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Microalgal biofuels are one of the best alternatives to replace the nonrenewable fossil fuels. Microalgae offer various advantages, the most beneficial being their high growth rate and ability to grow on waste waters. Many microalgal species have been assessed and studied for biofuel production, and have shown varying amounts of lipid contents. Harvesting the microalgae and extracting the stored lipids is a major hurdle for biofuel production technology, due to their tough cell walls. This review focuses on techniques for harvesting, cell disruption and lipid extraction of microalgae used for biofuel production. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Cutaneotrichosporon oleaginosus ATCC 20509 is a fast-growing oleaginous basidiomycete yeast that is able to grow in a wide range of low-cost carbon sources including crude glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production. When glycerol is used as a carbon source, this yeast can accumulate more than 50% lipids (w/w) with high concentrations of mono-unsaturated fatty acids. Results: To increase our understanding of this yeast and to provide a knowledge base for further industrial use, a FAIR re-annotated genome was used to build a genome-scale, constraint-based metabolic model containing 1553 reactions involving 1373 metabolites in 11 compartments. A new description of the biomass synthesis reaction was introduced to account for massive lipid accumulation in conditions with high carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio in the media. This condition-specific biomass objective function is shown to better predict conditions with high lipid accumulation using glucose, fructose, sucrose, xylose, and glycerol as sole carbon source. Conclusion: Contributing to the economic viability of biodiesel as renewable fuel, C. oleaginosus ATCC 20509 can effectively convert crude glycerol waste streams in lipids as a potential bioenergy source. Performance simulations are essential to identify optimal production conditions and to develop and fine tune a cost-effective production process. Our model suggests ATP-citrate lyase as a possible target to further improve lipid production. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The current research work focuses on the conventional bio-catalysed synthesis of amyl levulinate with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B in the absence of a toxic solvent. The green catalyst and solvent free system offered considerable benefits like mild and gentle condition requirement, lesser-energy demand, easy down-streaming and reusability of the biocatalyst. The process parameters were examined, and the maximum conversion (73.2 %) was obtained under the optimum condition of 50℃ temperature, 1:3 M ratio of levulinic acid to amyl alcohol using 0.8 % (w/v) biocatalyst at 250 rpm speed. The immobilized lipase was characterized by SEM, BET, XRD, FTIR and amyl levulinate was characterized by FTIR and GC–MS analysis. The enzyme lipase was effectively reused till 5 cycles for the formation of ester. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS) and energy of activation (Ea) were determined for the assessment of energy requirement. The activation energy was determined to be 48.42 kJ/mol. The research protocol strikes the development of biocatalytic synthetic route of amyl levulinate without using any toxic solvent, which may contribute to green chemistry approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sargassum spp is an invasive macroalgae and an alternative feedstock for bioethanol production. Sargassum spp biomass was subjected to high-pressure technology for biomass fractionation under different operating conditions of temperature and residence time to obtain glucan enriched pretreated solids (32.22 g/100 g of raw material). Enzyme hydrolysis process at high pretreated solid loading (13%, w/v) and enzyme loading of 10 FPU/g of glucan was performed, obtaining 43.01 g/L of glucose corresponding to a conversion yield of 92.12%. Finally, a pre-simultaneous saccharification and fermentation strategy (PSSF) was performed to produce bioethanol. This operational strategy produced 45.66 g/L of glucose in the pre-saccharification stage, and 18.14 g/L of bioethanol was produced with a glucose to bioethanol conversion yield of 76.23%. The development of this process highlights the feasibility of bioethanol production from macroalgal biomass in the biorefinery concept. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Chain elongation produce medium chain carboxylates, which are important precursors to many pharmaceuticals, antimicrobials and biofuels. Results in the presented investigations show that the supply of nano zero-valent iron (NZVI) can enhance caproate production. The highest caproate concentration achieved amounted to 27.2 mmol/L when 5 g/L NZVI were added, which was about 100% higher than the control. The study also showed increase of ethanol oxidation and decrease of butyrate and butanol with NZVI addition. Mechanism study showed NZVI can stimulate caproate production by preventing pH to fall below 5.4 through displacement reaction. Electron balance analysis displayed that NZVI provides extra electron by promoting ethanol oxidation and its dissolution. H2 was the potential electron shuttle between NZVI and chain elongators; High throughput sequencing showed function of NZVI on reshaping of microbial communities, especially enriching Oscillibacter Marseille-P3260, a kind of chain elongator and Corynebacterium which possesses fatty acid biosynthesis and iron utilization. © 2021

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from waste edible oil (WEO) using MnFe2O4/graphene oxide catalyst was investigated. For this purpose, the surface characterization of the catalyst was determined using SEM, EDX/Map, XRD, VSM, BET, TGA-DTG, CO2-TPD and FTIR analyses. The catalyst could be easily removed from the reactant due to its paramagnetic property. The BET analysis showed that the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst has a significant specific surface area, which is suitable for the transesterification reaction. Also, the CO2-TPD analysis showed that the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst has two broad and strong peaks at a temperature range of 800–900 °C, which indicates strong interactions between CO2 and active sites on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the total number of basic sites on the catalyst surface was obtained 3978.6 μmol of CO2/g of the catalyst, which is a significant value. Due to the presence of high free fatty acids (2.43 wt%) in the WEO, a hydrochloric acid catalyst was used to reduce free fatty acid content before the transesterification process using the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst. The highest biodiesel yield was obtained 96.47%, which was a remarkable value compared to previous works. According to HNMR analysis, a peak was observed at 3.7 ppm, which was attributed to the methoxy group (O–CH3) on the methyl ester, indicating that biodiesel was properly produced. Then, biodiesel was blended with petro-diesel in various proportions (B25–B100) to improve its physical properties. According to the results, the physical characteristics of the biodiesel like flash point, viscosity, cloud point, density and pour point were obtained 176 °C, 5.4 mm2/s, 5 °C, −1 °C, and 882 kg/m3, respectively. Among these properties, the cloud point is not suitable and demonstrates that pure biodiesel can't be used in the engine in cold weather and should be used in combination with diesel. However, other properties were within the standard range. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi is an intriguing lipid producer that can produce triacylglycerol (TAG), a feedstock for biodiesel production. We previously reported that the L. starkeyi mutant E15 with high levels of TAG production compared with the wild-type was efficiently obtained using Percoll density gradient centrifugation. However, considering its use for biodiesel production, it is necessary to further improve the lipid productivity of the mutant. In this study, we aimed to obtain mutants with better lipid productivity than E15, evaluate its lipid productivity, and analyze lipid synthesis-related gene expression in the wild-type and mutant strains. The mutants E15-11, E15-15, and E15-25 exhibiting higher lipid productivity than E15 were efficiently isolated from cells exposed to ultraviolet light using Percoll density gradient centrifugation. They exhibited approximately 4.5-fold higher lipid productivity than the wild-type on day 3. The obtained mutants did not exhibit significantly different fatty acid profiles than the wild-type and E15 mutant strains. E15-11, E15-15, and E15-25 exhibited higher expression of acyl-CoA synthesis- and Kennedy pathway-related genes than the wild-type and E15 mutant strains. Activation of the pentose phosphate pathway, which supplies NADPH, was also observed. These results suggested that the increased expression of acyl-CoA synthesis- and Kennedy pathway-related genes plays a vital role in lipid productivity in the oleaginous yeast L. starkeyi. © 2021 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Streptomyces pactum (Act12), an agent of a gentle in situ remediation approach, has been recently used in few works in phytoextraction trials; however, the impact of Act12 on soil quality and metal phytoavailability has not been assessed in multi-metal contaminated soils. Consequently, here we assessed the potential impact of Act12 on the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth, antioxidants activity, and the metal bioavailability in three industrial and mining soils collected from China and contained up to 118, 141, 339, and 6625 mg Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn kg−1 soil, respectively. The Act12 was applied at 0 (control), 0.75 (Act-0.75), 1.50 (Act-1.5), and 2.25 (Act-2.25) g kg−1 (dry weight base) to the three soils; thereafter, the soils were cultivated with wheat (bio-indicator plant) in a pot experiment. The addition of Act12 (at Act-1.5 and Act-2.25) promoted wheat growth in the three soils and significantly increased the content of Cd, Cu, and Zn in the roots and shoots and Pb only in the roots (up to 121%). The Act12-induced increase in metals uptake by wheat might be attributed to the associated decrease in soil pH and/or the increase of metal chelation and production of indole acetic acid and siderophores. The Act12 significantly decreased the antioxidant activities and lipid peroxidation in wheat, which indicates that Act12 may mitigate metals stress in contaminated soils. Enhancing metals phytoextraction using Act12 is a promising ecofriendly approach for phytoremediation of metal-contaminated mining soils that can be safely utilized with non-edible plants and/or bioenergy crops. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fossil fuel issues due to toxic carbon dioxide emissions and climate change have a direct link with the particulate matter that has caused severe threat to the environment. The bio-based products such as biodiesel and bio-compressed natural gas (Bio-CNG) can be less expensive and adaptable. Biofuels are increasingly being used in transportation, heat, and power development requiring the need for renewable sources of energy. This review highlights the use of dreck organic matters from aquatic environment and soil supplies for renewable energy production for human requirements, sustaining a clean and healthy environment. Dreck can be harnessed to manufacture bioenergy that would help to mitigate greenhouse gases and preserve the environment. Methane, hydrogen, ethanol, bioelectricity, algal diesel, and butanol, or other forms of fuels provide a renewable supply of bioenergy, which can be created by the biological systems. The waste-to-energy methodologies (thermal plus biochemical) for energy production via agro-residues are covered. The key focus of this study is the recent advances in the area of 'synchronous waste mitigation with energy development' techniques. This review addresses the significance of organic substances for the production of clean and renewable energy, including alternate solutions for non-renewable fuels. The needs for appropriate and renewable alternatives for fossil fuels are discussed. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Efficient enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose in lignocellulose to glucose is one of the most critical steps for the production of biofuels. The nonproductive adsorption of lignin to expensive cellulase highly impedes the development of biorefinery. Understanding the lignin-cellulase interaction mechanism serves as a vital basis for reducing such nonproductive adsorption in their practical applications. Yet, limited report is available on the direct characterization of the lignin-cellulase interactions. Herein, for the first time, the nanomechanics of the biomacromolecules including lignin, cellulase, and cellulose were systematically investigated by using a surface force apparatus (SFA) at the nanoscale in aqueous solutions. Interestingly, a cation-π interaction was discovered and demonstrated between lignin and cellulase molecules through SFA measurements with the addition of different cations (Na+, K+, etc.). The complementary adsorption tests and theoretical calculations further confirmed the validity of the force measurement results. This finding further inspired the investigation of the interaction between lignin and other noncatalytic-hydrolysis protein (i.e., soy protein). Soy protein was demonstrated as an effective, biocompatible, and inexpensive lignin-blocker based on the molecular force measurements through the combined effects of electrostatic, cation-π, and hydrophobic interactions, which significantly improved the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiencies of cellulose in pretreated lignocellulosic substrates. Our results offer quantitative information on the fundamental understanding of the lignin-cellulase interaction mechanism. Such unraveled nanomechanics provides new insights into the development of advanced biotechnologies for addressing the nonproductive adsorption of lignin to cellulase, with great implications on improving the economics of lignocellulosic biorefinery. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Utilized and waste jasmine flower contains a high portion of organic carbohydrate and other organic acids, making it a suitable substrate for bioethanol production. This study was designed to estimate the prospective of waste jasmine flower biomass applied with chemical (alkaline) and thermal pretreatment applied on samples through bioethanol production efficiencies. Therefore, pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis are directed to disrupt the complex cell wall layer and improve the accessibility towards polysaccharide fraction. Also, applying response surface methodology tools during fermentative bioethanol production to study the interactive effects of different bioprocess variables for higher bioethanol yield in batch small and large scale model is discussed. The immobilized yeast between jasmine found that jasmine sugar utilization was 50%. The jasmine flower's ethanol production was 6.54 g/L and after distillation of jasmine was 31.40 g/L at pH 4.5. Results showed that this immobilized yeast method could be successfully used for bioethanol production from waste jasmine flower. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - In this paper, an epoxy-activated cloisite (ECL) was prepared as a new heterofunctional carrier via a reaction between cloisite 30B (CL) and epichlorohydrin and utilized for covalent immobilization of lipase from Candida rugosa. The lipase immobilized on the ECL (LECL) was successfully used in the olive oil hydrolysis, synthesis of isoamyl acetate (banana flavor), and biodiesel production. The TGA, FT-IR, SEM, and XRD were used to characterize CL, ECL, and LECL. The influences of temperature, pH, thermal stability, and storage capacity were examined in the olive oil hydrolysis. The effects of solvent, temperature, time, water content, and substrates molar ratio on the yields of ester and biodiesel were also investigated. In the optimized conditions, the hydrolytic activity of LECL was 1.85 ± 0.05 U/ mg, and the maximum yield of ester and biodiesel was 91.6% and 95.4%, respectively. The LECL showed good thermal stability and storage capacity compared to the free lipase. Additionally, LECL was reusable for both esterification and transesterification after being used for nine cycles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wearable devices that generate power using sweat have garnered much attention in the field of skin electronics. These devices require high performance with a small volume and low production rate of sweat by living organisms. Here we demonstrate a high-power biofuel cell bracelet based on the lactate in human sweat. The biofuel cell was developed by using a lactate oxidase/osmium-based mediator/carbon nanotube fiber for lactate oxidation and a bilirubin oxidase/carbon nanotube fiber for oxygen reduction; the fibers were woven into a hydrophilic supportive textile for sweat storage. The storage textile was sandwiched between a hydrophobic textile for sweat absorption from the skin and a hydrophilic textile for water evaporation to improve sweat collection. The performance of the layered cell was 74 μW at 0.39 V in 20 mM artificial sweat lactate, and its performance was maintained at over 80% for 12 h. Furthermore, we demonstrated a series-connection between anode/cathode fibers by tying them up to wrap the bracelet-type biofuel cell on the wrist. The booster six-cell bracelet generated power at 2.0 V that is sufficient for operating digital wrist watches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of efficient and reusable catalysts is desired to improve biodiesel production process. For this purpose, the magnetic Fe3O4/ZIF-8 composites were first prepared by incorporating ZIF-8 MOF into Fe3O4 nanoparticles through in-situ approach, and then a vanadium-substituted heteropolyacid (HPA), H6PV3MoW8O40, was encapsulated in the support to afford the solid catalyst. The so-prepared catalysts were characterized by using XRD, FT-IR, TEM, SEM, TG, VSM, and nitrogen porosimetry measurement. Results revealed that the Fe3O4/ZIF-8 support was really formed, and the HPAs had been loaded on the magnetic composite. The catalytic performances of the developed catalysts were evaluated for the heterogeneous biodiesel production from the low-quantity oils. This catalyst had good magnetic responsiveness, and could catalyze the transesterification of soybean oil and esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) simultaneously, thus achieving one-step transformation of triglycerides and FFAs to biodiesel in a heterogeneous manner. The transesterification conversion obtained was 92.6% with 30:1 methanol/oil molar ratio at a catalyst loading of 6 wt% and reaction temperature of 160 °C for 10 h. Moreover, the solid catalyst could be recycled by an external magnet, and displayed a good reusability with a minimal mass loss and a slight decrease in the activity after reuse for five runs. This protocol showed great potential for sustainable biodiesel production from the low-quantity oils due to the pronounced activity and good reusability of the solid catalyst. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy-driven biorefineries can be designed considering biotechnological and thermochemical conversion pathways. Nevertheless, energy and environmental comparisons are necessary to establish the best way to upgrade lignocellulosic biomass and set the requirements of these processes in different scenarios. This paper aims to evaluate experimentally a biorefinery producing energy vectors using coffee-cut stems (CCS) as feedstock. The obtained yields were the basis for energy and environmental analysis, in two different biorefinery scenarios: (i) production of bioethanol and biogas and (ii) production of syngas and electricity. The energy results indicated that the overall energy efficiency calculated in the first scenario was only 9.15%. Meanwhile, the second biorefinery configuration based on thermochemical routes presented an energy efficiency value of 70.89%. This difference was attributed to the higher consumption of utilities in the biorefinery based on biotechnological routes. The environmental results showed that the impact category of climate change for the first biorefinery (i.e., 0.0193 kg CO2 eq./MJ) had a lower value than that of the second process (i.e., 0.2377 kg CO2 eq./MJ). Thus, the biorefinery based on the biotechnological route presented a better environmental performance. Additionally, the results for both biorefineries allowed concluding that the inclusion of by-products and co-products in the calculation of the environmental analysis can dramatically affect the results. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Printable wearable lactate biosensors have attracted significant attention, and printable lactate biofuel cells have gained popularity as suitable power supplies for these sensors. However, realizing an appropriate power supply for the practical application of these sensors as wearable devices, it is necessary to improve the output of lactate biofuel cells. In this study, we fabricated a lactate biofuel cell that employed paper substrate using screen printing. The proposed paper-based biofuel cell (PBFC) features a novel electrode design that affords an open circuit voltage of approximately 3.4 V when using an array with six cells in series. Furthermore, a 6 × 6 array of the lactate biofuel cell, i.e., an array comprising six cells in series and six cells in parallel, yielded a power output of 4.3 mW. To the best of our knowledge, this output of the proposed design is higher than those of previously reported lactate biofuel cells. Arrays of the proposed cell were capable of driving a Bluetooth low-energy device for wireless transmission, without requiring a booster circuit. A commercially available activity meter could be driven for 1.5 h using artificial sweat to fuel a 6 × 6 array of the PBFCs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Usually, Euro banknotes are made from cotton substrates and their waste is disposed of in landfill or is incinerated. In order to valorize the end-of-life euro banknotes (ELEBs), the substrates were used in this research for cellulase production via submerged fungal fermentation (SFF), and the resultant fungal cellulase w s used in ELEBs hydrolysis process for extraction of glucose. The experiments were started by exposing the ELEBs to different types of pretreatments, including milling process, alkali (NaOH/urea solution), and acid leaching to remove any contamination (e.g. dyes) and to decrease the crystallinity of cellulose (the main element in cotton substrate) thus increasing the degradation rate during the fermentation process. The effect of pretreatments on the morphology and chemical composition of ELEBs was observed using Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry. Afterwards, Trichoderma reesei-DSM76 was used for cellulase production from the treated ELEBs with high cellulase activity (12.97 FPU/g). The resultant cellulase was upscaled in a bioreactor and used in ELEBs hydrolysis. Finally, the results showed that the optimized pretreatment methods (milling followed by leaching process) significantly improved the cellulase activity and glucose recovery, which was estimated by 96%. According to the obtained results, the developed strategy has a great potential for conversion of ELEBs into a glucose product that could be used in biofuels and bioplastics applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study has investigated on two objectives which are enhancing the microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 cell disruption mechanism using thermal Fenton reaction and performing non-catalytic transesterification by ultra-sonication method. Radicles generated by Fenton reaction are rapid, dynamic, and the reaction was assisted by thermal heating to optimize the kinetic of the radical generation by obtained the lipid recovery for 53.3% and 977.41 mg/g at 36.5 °C with 4 min of contact time. The conversion of lipid into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) through rapid non-catalytic transesterification using ultrasound was also performed. The significant parameters were done by varying the ratio of methanol to lipid, duration and pulse mode of sonication, to optimize the bonding reaction with methyl ester compound to free fatty acids. The formation of hydrocarbon chains with C4, C6, and C10 was observed at 8.20 mg/g, 0.33 mg/g, and 0.24 mg/g, respectively. This is a promising method as it is marketable and can be conducted in large scale with high process yield of F.A.M.E in a rapid manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Efficient electrocatalytic energy conversion requires devices to function reversibly, that is, to deliver a substantial current at a minimal overpotential. Redox-active films can effectively embed and stabilize molecular electrocatalysts, but mediated electron transfer through the film typically makes the catalytic response irreversible. Here we describe a redox-active film for bidirectional (oxidation or reduction) and reversible hydrogen conversion, which consists of [FeFe] hydrogenase embedded in a low-potential, 2,2′-viologen-modified hydrogel. When this catalytic film served as the anode material in a H2/O2 biofuel cell, an open circuit voltage of 1.16 V was obtained—a benchmark value near the thermodynamic limit. The same film also acted as a highly energy efficient cathode material for H2 evolution. We explained the catalytic properties using a kinetic model, which shows that reversibility can be achieved even though intermolecular electron transfer is slower than catalysis. This understanding of reversibility simplifies the design principles of highly efficient and stable bioelectrocatalytic films, advancing their implementation in energy conversion.

AB  - Microalgae harvesting is the crucial step in algal biofuel production, which accounts 20–30% of the total production cost. The present study investigates the potentiality of anaerobic sludge-driven extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) as a bioflocculant. Five different methods, including physical and chemical, have been employed for EPS extraction from anaerobic sludge. Chemically extracted EPS showed better performance in microalgae harvesting as compared to physical ones. Maximum flocculation efficiency of 91.8 % was obtained using 30 mL L−1 EPS (0.40 g EPS g−1 biomass) extracted by formaldehyde-NaOH. However, microalgal lipid content was drastically decreased using chemically extracted EPS. In contrast, EPS extracted by thermal method had no significant effect on lipid recovery. Combining the bioflocculation performance and the lipid recovery suggests that the thermally extracted EPS was the most suitable for microalgae dewatering. Kinetic analysis revealed that pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2 = 0.979 – 0.999) and intra-particle diffusion (R2 = 0.974 – 0.986) are the most qualified for modeling of microalgal flocculation. Cost analysis showed that the cost of microalgae harvesting using EPS extracted by the thermal method was USD 1.95 and USD 4.9 for the recovery of 1 kg biomass and that of 1 kg lipid, respectively. The study was an attempt to develop a suitable microalgae harvesting technique using bio-based flocculant derived from a renewable resource. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sugar derived from lignocellulosic biomass is an important intermediate product, often used for the production of biofuels and value-added chemicals. It is therefore essential to understand and reduce the production costs of sugar derived from lignocellulosic biomass. This study evaluates the economic feasibility of a biorefinery producing sugar from lignocellulosic biomass using a combination of autohydrolysis and mechanical refining pretreatment. This biorefinery is self-sufficient in energy, producing excess electricity for sale. The minimum sugar selling price (MSSP) that achieves a zero net present value is $446/metric ton. The possibility of using the two main by-products, dissolved hemicellulose and lignin, for the production of high-value products, xylitol and polyol, is also evaluated. When dissolved hemicellulose is used for xylitol production, the MSSP decreases to $347/metric ton. When lignin is liquefied to produce polyol, the MSSP is further reduced to $342/metric ton. External energy (natural gas) must be purchased if xylitol and polyol are produced. An analysis of capital and operating costs reveals that, although the production of xylitol and polyol incurs additional capital investment, their correspondingly high values outweigh the additional capital costs. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that efficient recovery and recycling of expensive chemicals like acetone and glycerol are key to the success of the biorefinery. Yields of xylitol and polyol also have strong impacts on the process economics. © 2020 Society of Industrial Chemistry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The potential application of biodevices based on enzymatic bioelectrocatalysis are limited by poor stability and electrochemical performance. To solve the limitation, modifying enzyme with functional polymer to tailor enzyme function is highly desirable. Herein, glucose oxidase (GOx) was chosen as a model enzyme, and according to the chemical structure of GOx cofactor (flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD), we customize a biomimetic cofactor containing vinyl group (SFAD) for GOx, and prepared an GOx nanocapsule via in-situ polymerization. The characterization of particle size distribution, TEM, fluorescence and electrochemical performance indicated the successful formation of electroactive GOx nanocapsule with SFAD-containing polymeric network (n (GOx-SFAD-PAM)). The network can act as an electronic “highway” to link the active site with electrode, with capability to accelerate electron transfer as well as enhanced GOx stability. Further investigation of bioelectrocatalysis shows that n (GOx-SFAD-PAM)-based biosensor has low detection potential (−0.4 vs. Ag/AgCl), high sensitivity (64.97 μAmM−1cm−2), good anti-interference performance, quick response (3⁓5s) and excellent stability, and that n (GOx-SFAD-PAM)-based enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) has the high maximum power density (1011.21 μWcm−2), which is a 385-fold increase over that of native GOx-based EBFC (2.62 μWcm−2). This study suggests that novel enzyme nanocapsule with electroactive polymeric shell might provide a prospective solution for the performance improvement of enzymatic bioelectrocatalysis-based biodevices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, wastewater processing through anaerobic digestion can generate not only biofuels such as biohydrogen and methane, but also value-added soluble-phase intermediates (e.g. carboxylic acids), which have numerous applications. This study investigates the potential of using sugarcane vinasse, the main byproduct from ethanol production, as substrate in dark fermentation to recover soluble metabolites through the biorefinery approach. The impacts of temperature (30–60 °C) and initial pH (5.0–10.0) were initially assessed in batch tests using microbial consortia obtained from the natural fermentation of vinasse. The yield (401 mg-CODorganic acids g−1CODtinitial) and productivity (653 mg-CODorganic acids L−1 d−1) of organic acids were maximized at alkaline/mesophilic (pH = 8.8–10.0; 40 °C) conditions. Acetic-type fermentation prevailed at 30–40 °C, whilst butyrate was the primary metabolite at a higher temperature (60 °C). Further chain elongation-based experiments were conducted by adding ethanol and lactate as exogenous carbon sources in vinasse fermentation, also using vinasse-derived microbial consortia as the inoculum. Lactate was added as both chemical reactant and fermented cassava flour wastewater (fCFW). Ethanol addition was irrelevant to the acidogenic activity. Conversely, lactate addition directly increased the production of propionic, butyric, (iso)valeric, and caproic acids, with a predominance of butyrate. Chain elongation was particularly favored when adding fCFW with pH adjusted to 7.0, boosting the generation of caproic acid from lactate and butyrate and (iso)valeric acid from acetate and propionate. These results highlight the potential for producing organic acids from vinasse as an alternative to gaseous fuels, expanding the suitability of dark fermentation targeting bioresource recovery from sugarcane. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A dual-function cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-based bionic biosensor with good biocompatibility was developed for detecting Ag+ and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by grafting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) onto CNF. The Ag+ ions captured by the biosensor acted as recognition sites for the detection of AChE. The CNF-based bionic biosensor (CNF-DNA) could detect Ag+ concentrations as low as 10−6 nM in the presence of interference metal ions (Hg2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+). DNA-template silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) were formed on the surface of CNF-DNA during the detection of Ag+ (CNF-DNA-AgNCs). This new strategy yielded CNF-DNA-AgNCs through the adsorption of Ag+ ions onto the cytosine base of the single-stranded DNA in CNF-DNA without the use of any additional reducer. Meanwhile, the CNF-DNA-AgNCs exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity for trace levels (0.053 mU/mL) of AChE in the presence of interference reagents. The novel strategy proposed in this paper may establish a foundation for further research on DNA-template AgNCs for developing biosensors and biomarkers for in vivo and in vitro detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A biorefinery is an efficient approach to generate multiple bio-products from biomass. With the increasing demand for bioenergy and bio-products, biorefineries are essential industrial platforms that provide needed demand while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A biorefinery consists of various conversion technologies where particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted. The released PM and VOCs pose detrimental health and environmental risks for society. Moreover, the projected rise of global bioenergy demand may lead to an increase in PM and VOCs from biorefineries. With the use of cleaner technologies and approaches, PM and VOCs can be avoided in biorefineries. The study presents the landscape of the research field through a bibliometric review of emissions from a biorefinery. A comprehensive review of works on the reduction of PM and VOCs in a biorefinery is outlined. The study includes a perspective of cleaner technologies and approaches utilized in biorefineries to mitigate these hazardous materials. The results reveal that the employment of life cycle assessment, safety assessment, and green chemistry processes can significantly reduce PM and VOC emissions as well as the consumption of hazardous substances in the biorefinery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In present study, chitinolytic bacteria were employed to bioaugment the biogas production from fungal pretreated agricultural residues. The fungal pretreatment of wheat and pearl millet straw was done by Chaetomium globosporum. Pretreated straw were digested anaerobically at batch scale with and without the presence of chitinolytic bacteria. Contrary to untreated samples, the addition of chitionolytic bacteria with pretreated wheat and pearl millet straw provided 41 and 57% higher biogas yield. The study was further upscaled to continuous stirred tank reactors. At continuous scale too, wheat straw pretreated with Chaetomium globosporum combined with chitinolytic bacteria resulted in 16% higher biogas yield in contrast to untreated straw. Higher abundance of methanogens was detected in reactors running with pretreated wheat straw during microbial community analysis. The identified bacteria belonged mostly to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria phyla. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crop straws represent enormous biomass resource convertible for biofuels and bioproducts, but lignocellulose recalcitrance restricts its saccharification for commercial utility. Despite genetic modification of lignin biosynthesis being attempted to reduce recalcitrance in bioenergy crops, it remains challenging to optimize lignin deposition without an unacceptable yield penalty. Based on gene expression analysis and phylogenetic tree profiling, a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene (OsCAD2) as the target for genetic engineering of lignin biosynthesis in rice was selected in this study. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, independent homozygous transgenic lines with precise site mutation of OsCAD2, which showed slightly reduced lignin levels but markedly decreased p-hydroxyphenyl (H) contents in lignin by 34% and increased guaiacyl (G) contents by 16%, compared to the wild type were generated in this study. Under mild alkali pretreatment (1% NaOH, 50°C), the OsCAD2 site-modified lines showed effective lignin extraction up to 70% (of total lignin) from mature rice straws, which caused either significantly increased biomass porosity and cellulose accessibility or remarkably reduced cellulase adsorption to lignin in pretreated lignocellulose residues. These consequently led to almost complete biomass enzymatic saccharification with increased hexoses yields by 61%–72% in the modified lines, being much higher than those of the lignin-altered lines reported in previous studies. Hence, this study has demonstrated a novel genetic engineering strategy to reduce lignocellulose recalcitrance with minimized biomass loss for cost-effective biomass conversion to bioethanol in rice and bioenergy crops. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The up-flow anaerobic hybrid reactor (UAHR) was simultaneously employed for 2-biofuels (H2 and CH4) production from solely biscuits wastewater (BW) industry and a mixture of BW with domestic sewage (DS) at a mixing ratio of 3:1 respectively. The UAHR was fed with BW and operated at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 21.9 ± 1.7 gCOD/L/d., and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12.0 h. The module achieved volumetric hydrogen production rate (VHPR) and hydrogen yield (HY) of 0.95 ± 0.13 L/L reactor/d., and 118.6 ± 22.3 mL/gCODremoved respectively. A substantial deterioration in the H2 productivity was occurred after 94 days of continuous-feed operation, due to the inhibition effect of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). DS was integrated into the BW at mixing ratio of 3.0 (BW):1.0 (DS) where the UAHR was continuously operated at OLRs of 7.95 and 4.45 gCOD/L/d., achieving H2 and CH4 yields of 414.2 ± 38.1 and 318.5 ± 23.5 mL/gCOD removed, respectively. The payback periods for the production of biogas rich CH4 and H2 were 7.1 and 5.7 y respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the factors hindering the development of enzymatic biosensors and biofuel cells in real-life applications is the time-dependant degradation of the biocatalysts on electrode surfaces. In this work, we present a new practical approach for extending the operation lifetimes of bioelectrocatalytic assemblies based on bilirubin oxidase (BOD). As evident by both spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, an adsorption of carbon-coated magnetic nanoparticles (ccMNPs) onto a BOD/carbon nanotubes-deposited surface yields a stable bioelectrocathode system for mediatorless oxygen reduction. As compared to electrodes, which were stored without a preliminary interaction with the ccMNPs, an 80% increase in the active enzymatic content and the electrocatalytic performance was evident for the modified assemblies over a course of one month. As the full removal of the protective particles before the measurement requires only a single step applying an external magnetic force, the method is shown to be simple, reproducible, and easy to implement.

AB  - Olive-derived biomass is not only a renewable bioenergy resource but also it can be a source of bioproducts, including antioxidants. In this study, the antioxidant composition of extracted olive pomace (EOP) and a new byproduct, the residual fraction from olive pit cleaning (RFOPC or residual pulp) was characterized and compared to olive leafy biomass, which have been extensively studied as a source of antioxidants and other bioactive compounds with pharmacological properties. The chemical characterization showed that these byproducts contain a high amount of extractives; in the case of EOP, it was even higher (52.9%) than in olive leaves (OL) and olive mill leaves (OML) (35.8–45.1%). Then, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was applied to recover antioxidants from the extractive fraction of these biomasses. The solubilization of antioxidants was much higher for EOP, correlating well with the extractives content and the total extraction yield. Accordingly, this also affected the phenolic richness of the extracts and the differences between all biomasses were diminished. In any case, the phenolic profile and the hydroxytyrosol cluster were different. While OL, OML, and EOP contained mainly hydroxytyrosol derivatives and flavones, RFOPC presented novel trilignols. Other compounds were also characterized, including secoiridoids, hydroxylated fatty acids, triterpenoids, among others, depending on the bioresource. Moreover, after the UAE extraction step, alkaline extraction was applied recovering a liquid and a solid fraction. While the solid fraction could of interest for further valorization as a biofuel, the liquid fraction contained proteins, sugars, and soluble lignin, which conferred antioxidant properties to these extracts, and whose content depended on the biomass and conditions applied. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is a typical renewable and green energy, that is usually produced by the transesterification of edible vegetable oils. However, the cost of edible vegetable oils as feedstock accounts for 60%–80% of the total cost of biodiesel production. To overcome these issues, in this work, a low-cost feedstock, waste phoenix seed oil (PSO) with a high free fatty acid (FFA) content (30.1 ± 0.6%), consisting of the main fatty acid, linoleic acid (30.2%), oleic acid (22.2%), and palmitic acid (17.4%), was developed as a new feedstock to prepare biodiesel. A novel one-step method including simultaneous esterification of FFAs and transesterification of the PSO to prepare biodiesel was developed. Free lipase was used as catalyst. The influences of the reaction parameters were explored and optimized by response surface methodology. The results showed that the free lipase Lipozyme TL100L from Thermomyces lanuginosus can simultaneously catalyze esterification and transesterification. Under the optimum conditions (enzyme load 9.7%, reaction time 6.9 h, reaction temperature 31 °C and substrate ratio (methanol/PSO) 4.3: 1 (mol/mol)), the maximum biodiesel yield (93.8 ± 0.5%) was achieved. The activation energy from biodiesel preparation using PSO with a high FFA content was 39.7 kJ/mol. Furthermore, the kinetic values for K'm and Vmax were 0.18 mol/L and 0.043 mol/(L·min), respectively. The reaction mechanism of the simultaneous esterification and transesterification was also proposed. These results indicate that PSO with a high FFA content can be used as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2020

AB  - Oleaginous algae have the ability to synthesize a high level of triacylglycerol (TAG) and are considered as the next-generation feedstock for biofuel production. Manipulating algal lipid biosynthetic pathways has potential to overproduce TAG and represents a feasible way toward bringing down algae-derived biofuels production cost. Here we dissected functional roles and engineering potential of six diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) genes from the marine alga Phaeodactylum tricornutum. PtDGAT1, PtDGAT2B, and PtDGAT3, residing at the chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (ER) readily for utilizing both chloroplast- and ER-derived diacylglycerol, were transcriptionally correlated with TAG accumulation. Heterologous expression in yeast, in vitro assay and overexpression in P. tricornutum all supported that PtDGAT1 surpassed the other five PtDGATs in synthesizing TAG. Compared to wild type P. tricornutum, the PtDGAT1-overexpressing strain produced more than doubled TAG and total lipids, which reached 57% and 73% of dry weight, respectively, record-high levels ever achieved in this alga. Our results demonstrated the strategy of screening proper engineering targets and manipulating a single gene to pull carbon flux to lipids for TAG hyper-accumulation without growth compromise. The engineered alga with a great trait improvement may serve as a potent lipid producer for production uses. © 2020 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Aerobic hydrolysis of stover before anaerobic digestion is beneficial to improve the biodegradability of corn stover. Aerobic hydrolysis of corn stover at 43 °C was conducted to investigate the effects of hydrolysis time (0 h, 8 h, 16 h, and 24 h) on the degradation of lignocellulose from corn stover and material conversion. Further anaerobic digestion and energy consumption analysis with the digestion temperature of 36 °C were carried out. The accumulation rate of volatile fatty acids began to slow down after 16 h of hydrolysis, and the concentration of acetic acid reached 221.85 mmol/L at 24 h of hydrolysis. The degradation rate of lignocellulose was obviously increased after hydrolysis. When the hydrolysis time was 16 h, it reached the maximum cumulative methane production with 268.75 ml/g VS. In terms of biogas production and energy conversion efficiency, it is more appropriate to choose 16 h as hydrolysis time in biogas engineering. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study assesses the environmental potential of crop residues and the techno-economic potential of biojet fuel (BJF) production in Brazil. Different production routes are evaluated from two types of biomass residues (sugarcane straw and eucalyptus harvest residue), and four different technological pathways (alcohol to jet, Fischer–Tropsch, hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis). The environmental potential of biomass residues is determined utilizing spatio-temporal projections of land-use change in Brazil and by explicitly modeling the erosion risk and the soil organic carbon (SOC) balance spatially. The assessment of the techno-economic potential of BJF production from the environmental potential of sugarcane straw (SCS) and eucalyptus harvest residues (EHRs) considers the BJF total costs, which result from a summation of biomass residue recovery costs, BJF conversion costs, and BJF transportation costs. These BJF total costs are compared with the range of fossil jet fuel prices at Brazilian airports to quantify the techno-economic potential. The environmental potential of biomass residues varies from 70 Mt in 2015 to 102 Mt in 2030, with SCS being highly constrained by SOC, whereas EHRs are more constrained by the high erosion risk. These quantities can generate a techno-economic BJF potential ranging from 0.45 EJ in 2015 (46 US$/GJ – 65 US$/GJ) to 0.67 EJ in 2030 (19 US$/GJ – 65 US$/GJ). In 2030, several BJF production routes can be competitive with fossil jet fuel prices. The northeast and southeast regions have the highest potential, especially in 2030. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The present experimental investigation has shown the biodiesel production from 2nd generation renewable carbon source, Karanja seed oil using graphene oxide (GO) immobilized lipase biocatalyst. The adsorption of lipase in GO was found to be most suitable immobilizing support matrix (adsorbed ~94 mg/g of GO) due to large specific surface area and abundant functional groups. The GO immobilized enzyme i.e. biocatalysts assisted enzymatic transesterification yielded ~88% of biodiesel using 1:8 Karanja oil: ethanol ratio, 25 °C, 3% biocatalysts in 24 h reaction time. The newly designed solar-driven direct contact membrane distillation module enables continuous separation and recycles of unreacted alcohol (&gt;99% recovery) from transesterification reaction mixture while yielding ~41 Kg EtOH/m2/24h using commercial PTFE/PET hydrophobic membrane. Subsequently, free glycerol was removed up to ~77% (permeate concentration ≤0.018 mass%) by cross-flow membrane module fitted with flat-sheet polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane. The integration of GO-based biocatalyst assisted transesterification and multi-staged membrane system for downstream enrichment of fatty acid ethyl ester culminates in the development of a cost-effective, energy-intensive and eco-friendly system which represents a sustainable biofuel production process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Algal-derived bioenergy is one of the best alternative energy sources to replace fossil-based fuels. Algae are a diverse collection of oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms with rapid growth capacity that utilise commonly available materials for growth. Biological CO2 mitigation using microalgae is an environmentally friendly and economical method. Besides this, algae are able to live in extreme environments containing high amounts of heavy metals, making this a useful way to treat wastewater. The biomass produced from algae also can be used as a source of energy, chemicals and food. However, to ensure that the optimum blooming capacity is reached for the production of high-yield biomass for bioenergy resources, growth factors such as absorbed CO2, nutrient availability, light energy, temperature, pH and agitation should be studied comprehensively. This article provides a selective overview of the past and present studies of algal growth and the factors that affect the production of algal biomass. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Terpenoids are a wide class of organic compounds with industrial relevance. The natural ability of cyanobacteria to produce terpenoids via the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway makes these organisms appealing candidates for the generation of light-driven cell factories for green chemistry. Here we address the improvement of the production of (E)-α-bisabolene, a valuable biofuel feedstock, in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 via sequential heterologous expression of bottleneck enzymes of the native pathway. Expression of the bisabolene synthase is sufficient to complete the biosynthetic pathway of bisabolene. Expression of a farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase from Escherichia coli did not influence production of bisabolene, while enhancement of the MEP pathway via additional overexpression of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and IPP/DMAPP isomerase (IDI) significantly increased production per cell. However, in the absence of a carbon sink, the overexpression of DXS and IDI leads to significant growth impairment. The final engineered strain reached a volumetric titre of 9 ​mg ​L−1 culture of bisabolene after growing for 12 days. When the cultures were grown in a high cell density (HCD) system, we observed an increase in the volumetric titres by one order of magnitude for all producing-strains. The strain with improved MEP pathway presented an increase twice as much as the remaining engineered strains, yielding more than 180 ​mg ​L−1 culture after 10 days of cultivation. Furthermore, the overexpression of these two MEP enzymes prevented the previously reported decrease in the bisabolene specific titres when grown in HCD conditions, where primary metabolism is usually favoured. We conclude that fine-tuning of the cyanobacterial terpenoid pathway is crucial for the generation of microbial platforms for terpenoid production on industrial-scale. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The availability of organic matters in vast quantities from the agricultural/industrial practices has long been a significant environmental challenge. These wastes have created global issues in increasing the levels of BOD or COD in water as well as in soil or air segments. Such wastes can be converted into bioenergy using a specific conversion platform in conjunction with the appropriate utilization of the methods such as anaerobic digestion, secondary waste treatment, or efficient hydrolytic breakdown as these can promote bioenergy production to mitigate the environmental issues. By the proper utilization of waste organics and by adopting innovative approaches, one can develop bioenergy processes to meet the energy needs of the society. Waste organic matters from plant origins or other agro-sources, biopolymers, or complex organic matters (cellulose, hemicelluloses, non-consumable starches or proteins) can be used as cheap raw carbon resources to produce biofuels or biogases to fulfill the ever increasing energy demands. Attempts have been made for bioenergy production by biosynthesizing, methanol, n-butanol, ethanol, algal biodiesel, and biohydrogen using different types of organic matters via biotechnological/chemical routes to meet the world's energy need by producing least amount of toxic gases (reduction up to 20–70% in concentration) in order to promote sustainable green environmental growth. This review emphasizes on the nature of available wastes, different strategies for its breakdown or hydrolysis, efficient microbial systems. Some representative examples of biomasses source that are used for bioenergy production by providing critical information are discussed. Furthermore, bioenergy production from the plant-based organic matters and environmental issues are also discussed. Advanced biofuels from the organic matters are discussed with efficient microbial and chemical processes for the promotion of biofuel production from the utilization of plant biomasses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is considered as a recalcitrant substrate for anaerobic digestion due to its complex nature that limits its biological degradation. Therefore, suitable preprocessing for the improvement of the performance of conventional anaerobic digestion remains a challenge in the development of anaerobic digestion technology. The physical and chemical characteristics of wheat straw (WS), as a representative lignocellulosic biomass, have a significant impact on the anaerobic digestion process in terms of quantity and quality of the produced biogas. This study aimed at investigating the enzymatic saccharification and detoxification of straw prior to anaerobic digestion with the final objective of enhancing the performance of conventional anaerobic systems of recalcitrant fractions of agricultural waste. The experimental activity was performed in lab and pilot scale treating WS. Alkaline delignification of straw using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was studied prior to enzymatic hydrolysis for the production of easily biodegradable sugars. After defining the optimum conditions for the pretreatment scheme, the anaerobic digestability of the effluents produced was measured. Finally, the final liquid effluents were fed to a pilot scale anaerobic digester of 0.5 m3 volume, applying an increasing organic loading rate (OLR) regime (in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from 0.2 to 15 kg COD/m3/day). The optimum conditions for the delignification and enzymatic hydrolysis of WS were defined as 0.5 M NaOH at 50 °C for 3–5 h and 15 μL Cellic CTec2/g pretreated straw at 50 °C. It was proven that the resulting liquid effluents could be fed to an anaerobic digester in the ratio that they are produced with satisfactory COD removal efficiencies (over 70%) for OLRs up to 10 kg COD/m3/day. This value is correspondent to a hydraulic retention time of around 7.5 days, much lower than the respective one for untreated straw (over 12 days). © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pretreatment is the most crucial and energy-intensive unit process affecting the feasibility of biorefinery, especially when lignin valorization is of concern. This study investigated and quantified the potential benefits of an innovative staged organosolv (OS)-dilute acid (DA) pretreatment process for whole oil palm tree residues conversion. The staged OS-DA pretreatment resulted in approximately five times higher net energy (1.50 GJ/tonne) over the single-step OSDA process (0.30GJ/tonne) due to potential energy saving on solvent recovery and less water consumption. For sugar, OS-DA pretreated substrate achieved more than 90% of cellulose digestibility which was more than 40% higher than DA-OS substrate. For mono-lignin, significant reduction in crude lignin condensation (21.7%) was confirmed by two-dimensional NMR analysis. The overall mass balance showed that approximately 142.45 tonnes of bioethanol, or a net energy yield of 969.5 GJ, can be produced by OS-DA process from palm tree residues per hectare of oil palm farm. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper explores the challenge to turn restaurant food waste from environmental issue to energy asset. The transformation of the dehydrated restaurant food waste to used oil, ethanol and methane was investigated. Each process unit was studied and optimised. Thermal dehydration was adopted producing a dried feedstock suitable for the downstream processes as well as a condensate rich in volatile fatty acids with a biomethane potential yield of 1.24 L CH4/L. In the oil extraction process, the application of hexane, 20 Soxhlet cycles and solvent to feedstock ratio equal to 2 provided 81.76% oil yield with quality suitable for transesterification. Different loadings of non-commercial amylolytic enzyme were examined so as to enhance the starch bioconversion efficiency. Five microlitres of enzyme per gramme of starch and 90 min of saccharification time were selected as the optimum operating conditions for producing a hydrolysate that could be efficiently fermented to ethanol. The anaerobic biodegradability of the resulting stillage (415 L CH4/kg VS) could further promote the viability of the whole treatment train. The experimental results were integrated in a material flow diagram in order to enlighten the assessment of the biorefinery scheme. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells can be efficiently used for simultaneous cleaning of wastewater and generation of electricity. This research demonstrates the applicability of Baker yeast cells in the design of microbial biofuel cells. The applicability the 9,10-phenantrenequinone (PQ) as a redox mediator in the design of yeast-based microbial cell (MFC) for the improvement of charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and cell wall towards the electrode was evaluated. The viability of bakers' yeast and pure Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell strains was investigated by evaluating the growth velocity of cells in the presence of a different concentration of PQ in solution. The growth curves of bakers' yeast showed that they were more resistant to PQ. Electrochemical measurements were performed with PQ as a redox mediator, which was (i) dissolved in solution and (ii) adsorbed on a graphite electrode. Differently modified graphite electrodes (namely: (i) non-modified, (ii) yeast-modified, (iii) modified by PQ and yeast) were evaluated. The modified electrodes were evaluated as anodes of MFC. The dependence of potential on external resistance and generated power of MFC was evaluated. Maximal open circuit potential was 178 mV at 7.8 mM of glucose and 23 mM of potassium ferricyanide. Maximal power of BFC calculated at the same conditions was registered at 56 mV, and it reached 22.2 mW/m2 (at 30 mM of glucose). The application of PQ as a redox mediator for yeast-based MFC improves electron transfer through the yeast cell membrane and cell wall towards electrode without any noticeable decrease of yeast cell viability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The magnetic graphene oxide (GO) supported with heterogeneous ternary mixed metal oxide (MMO) was used as nanocatalyst to enhance the conversion of waste frying oil (WFO) triglycerides to biodiesel via esterification process. In this regard, acidic MGO was modified with three basic metal cations of cerium, zirconium, and strontium oxides to produce heterogeneous MGO@MMO nanocatalyst. The nanocatalyst was characterized by FESEM, TEM, EDX and FTIR. The influence of different parameters such as catalyst material ratio, methanol to oil ratio, contact time, and reaction temperature was studied. Based on the results of effecting parameters, the MGO@MMO nanocatalyst converted WFO to biodiesel with a yield 94%, a reaction time of 90 min, methanol to oil ratio (8:1), and a temperature of 60 °C. Esterification mechanism indicated the MGO@MMO nanocatalyst having both binary Brønsted acid–base sites that increased the conversion yields as compared to MGO and MMO at low temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulose biodegradation is limited because of its recalcitrant structure particularly when polluted by toxic and carcinogenic compounds such as creosote oil (CRO). As far as we know, this might be the first report that explores the biodegradation of creosote treated wood (CTW) to serve biomethane production. Two novel CTW-degrading microbial consortia, designated as CTW-1 and CTW-2, were screened and constructed to enhance methane production from CRO-treated pine sawdust. After 12 days of biological pretreatment by CTW-1 and CTW-2, a significant reduction in lignocellulosic content of CTW was recorded; estimated as 49 and 43%, respectively. More than 64 and 91% of cumulative biogas and methane yields were obtained from biodegraded CTW over control. Ecotoxicity of treated and untreated CTW was compared by Microtox test. The biodegraded CTW hydrolysates showed a toxicity decrease of more than 80%, suggesting the promising role of constructed microbial consortia for biofuel production and bioremediation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cheese whey is an easily biodegradable substrate with high organic matter that can be anaerobically digested to biogas; however, the process is often inhibited by excess acidification due to the presence of undissociated volatile fatty acids and requires considerable concentration of alkaline buffer. The current study investigates a new approach for biogas upgrading, and increase of total CH4 in conjunction with buffering acidification by using zero-valent iron (powder and scrap metals at concentrations 25, 50, and 100 g/L) in anaerobic granular sludge and cheese whey under mesophilic batch conditions. During the first 2 cycles (total 34 days), a high performance was found in anaerobic bottles with 25 g/L powder zero valent iron (PZVI) and 50 g/L scrap zero valent iron (SZVI) since they had a higher total CH4 production compared to anaerobic bottles free of ZVI, as well as 97% CH4 composition in produced biogas compared to 74% CH4 for anaerobic bottles free of ZVI. Under these conditions, no additional NaOH was added to anaerobic bottles with 25 g/L PZVI and 50 g/L SZVI to increase the pH and at the end of 2nd cycle the concentration of VFAs was substantially lower compared to the anaerobic bottles free of ZVI. However, no positive effects of ZVI in terms of alkaline buffer were found at the 3rd and 4th cycle probably due to ZVI inactivation outer surface layer. Based on the experimental findings (anaerobic bottles: (a) 25 g/L PZVI, (b) 50 g/L SZVI and (c) free of ZVI) an economic comparison for anaerobic digestion of cheese whey by large scale was contacted and pointed out that the best scenario was the anaerobic digestion by addition of 50 g/L SZVI, followed by anaerobic digestion free of ZVI and last was the anaerobic digestion by addition of 25 g/L PZVI. This study highlights a new proof of concept for in-situ biogas upgrading and alleviation of acidification by addition of 50 g/L SZVI or 25 g/L PZVI during anaerobic digestion of cheese whey. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, an innovative approach was proposed based on the implement of biochar derived from residue cornstalk left after anaerobic bio-hydrogen production (RCA-biochar) to improve direct bio-hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of cornstalk. The bio-hydrogen production potential and maximum bio-hydrogen production rate increased from 156.2 to 286.1 mL H2/g substrate and 3.5 to 5.7 mL H2/g substrate/h, respectively, following the added RCA-biochar increased from 2.5 to 15.0 g/L. Cornstalk chemical component analysis showed the cellulose and hemicellulose content decreased by 17.9–33.7% and 14.4–25.2%, and lignin content increased by 20.3–42.8%, respectively, after 96 h anaerobic fermentation with RCA-biochar 2.5–15.0 g/L. Further analyses revealed that RCA-biochar not only provided more specific surface area for hydrogen-producing bacteria attachment, but also promoted the cellulolytic enzyme activity, thereby resulted in increased substrate conversion to bio-hydrogen. The findings obtained in this study may provide supports for effective and sustainable lignocellulosic bio-hydrogen production in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biohydrogen production in Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC) had inspired the researchers to overcome the challenges associated towards sustainability. Despite microbial community and various substrates, economical cathode catalyst development is most significant factor for enhancing hydrogen production in the MEC. Hence, in this study, the performance of MEC was investigated with a sugar industry effluent (COD 4200 ± 20 mg/L) with graphite anode and modified Nickel foam (NF) cathode. Nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) coated NF achieved a higher hydrogen production rate 0.12 ± 0.01 L.L−1D−1 as compared to control under favorable conditions. Electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the improved catalytic activity of novel nanocatalyst with lower impedance favoring faster hydrogen evolution kinetics. The MEC with the novel catalyst performed with 58.2% coloumbic efficiency, 20.36% cathodic hydrogen recovery, 11.96% overall hydrogen recovery and 54.38% COD removal efficiency for a 250 mL substrate during 5 days’ batch cycle. Hence, the potentiality of modified cathode was established with the real time industrial effluent highlighting the waste to wealth bio-electrochemical technology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This two-phase, two-stage study analyzed production of biohydrogen and volatile fatty acids by acidogenic fermentation of brewery spent grains. Phase-1 served to optimize the effect of pH (4–10) on acidogenic fermentation; whereas phase-2 validated the optimized conditions by scaling up the process to 2 L, 5 L, and 10 L. Alkaline conditions (pH 9) yielded excellent cumulative H2 production (834 mL) and volatile fatty acid recovery (8936 mg/L) in phase-1. Extended fermentation time (from 5 to 10 days) upgraded the accumulated short-chain fatty acids (C2–C4) to medium-chain fatty acids (C5–C6). Enrichment for acidogens in modified mixed culture improved fatty acid production; while their consumption by methanogens in unmodified culture led to methane formation. Increased CH4 but decreased H2 content enabled biohythane generation. Scaling up confirmed the role of pH and culture type in production of renewable fuels and platform molecules from brewery spent grains. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - In this work, the algal biomass productivity and its lipid content were explored using a database containing 4670 instances extracted from the experimental results reported in 102 published articles. First, the influences of critical factors such as microalgae species, cultivation conditions, light intensity, CO2 amount, nutrient concentrations, reactor type, stress conditions, cell disruption methods, and lipid extraction solvents on the biomass and lipid production were reviewed. Then, the database was analyzed using machine learning techniques; decision trees were utilized to determine the combination of variables leading to high biomass and lipid content while association rule mining was used to find the specific conditions leading to very high biomass and lipid levels. Decision tree analysis discovered 11 different combinations of variables leading to high biomass productivity and 13 combinations for high lipid content; whereas, association rule mining analysis helped to identify the levels of specific factors for very high biomass and lipid production. It was then concluded that machine learning methods can help to determine the best conditions for optimum biomass growth and lipid yield for microalgae to manufacture renewable biofuels, and this can guide the planning of new experimental works. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The World has experienced the negative effect of using the convectional fuels in both usage and emission aspects in automobile. Due to these factors, there is a search for an alternative fuel. There are several methods employed in the preparation of alternative fuel. Biodiesel is one of the efficient methods, in which edible and non-edible oils can be converted fuels (biodiesel) by means of esterification process. In this paper, the Study of milk scum biodiesel is analyzed in single cylinder four stroke diesel engines by using different blends like B10, B20 and B30 at different loading condition. From this investigation, B20 provide improvement in the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) compare to other biodiesel blends. The emission analysis shows the Unburnt Hydrocarbon (UBH) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) decreases and the Nitrogen oxide (NOx) increases for the blend B20. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The utilization of renewable lignocellulosic biomasses for bioenergy synthesis is believed to facilitate competitive commercialization and realize affordable clean energy sources in the future. Among the pathways for biomass pretreatment methods that enhance the efficiency of the whole biofuel production process, the combined microwave irradiation and physicochemical approach is found to provide many economic and environmental benefits. Several studies on microwave-based pretreatment technologies for biomass conversion have been conducted in recent years. Although some reviews are available, most did not comprehensively analyze microwave–physicochemical pretreatment techniques for biomass conversion. The study of these techniques is crucial for sustainable biofuel generation. Therefore, the biomass pretreatment process that combines the physicochemical method with microwave-assisted irradiation is reviewed in this paper. The effects of this pretreatment process on lignocellulosic structure and the ratio of achieved components were also discussed in detail. Pretreatment processes for biomass conversion were substantially affected by temperature, irradiation time, initial feedstock components, catalyst loading, and microwave power. Consequently, neoteric technologies utilizing high efficiency-based green and sustainable solutions should receive further focus. In addition, methodologies for quantifying and evaluating effects and relevant trade-offs should be develop to facilitate the take-off of the biofuel industry with clean and sustainable goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae is a renewable bioresource with the potential to replace the conventional fossil-based industrial production of organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the microalgal biomass contains carotenoids, vitamins, and other biomolecules that are widely used as food supplements. However, the microalgal biomass production, their composition variations, energy-intensive harvesting methods, optimized bio-refinery routes, and lack of techno-economic analysis are the major bottleneck for the life-sized commercialization of this nascent bio-industry. This review discusses the microalgae-derived key bioactive compounds and their applications in different sectors for human health. Furthermore, this review proposes advanced strategies to enhance the productivity of bioactive compounds and highlight the key challenges associated with a safety issue for use of microalgae biomass. It also provides a detailed global scenario and market demand of microalgal bioproducts. In conclusion, this review will provide the concept of microalgal biorefinery to produce bioactive compounds at industrial scale platform for their application in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical sector considering their current and future market trends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Grape pomace (GP) is a low-value by-product that contains a significant amount of high value-added products. The huge amount of non-edible residues of GP wastes (seeds, skins, leaves and, stems) produced by wine industries causes’ environmental pollution, management issues as well as economic loss. Studies over the past 15–20 years revealed that GP could serve as a potential source for valuable bioactive compounds like antioxidants, bioactive, nutraceuticals, single-cell protein, and volatile organic compounds with an increasing scientific interest in their beneficial effects on human and animal health. However, the selection of appropriate techniques for the extraction of these compounds without compromising the stability of the extracted products is still a challenging task for the researcher. Based on the current scenario, the review mainly summarizes the novel applications of winery wastes in many sectors such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, livestock fields, and also the bio-energy recovery system. We also summarize the existing information/knowledge on several green technologies for the recovery of value-added by-products. For the promotion of many emerging technologies, the entrepreneur should be aware of the opportunities/techniques for the development of high-quality value-added products. Thus, this review presents systematic information on value-added by-products that are used for societal benefits concerning the potential for human health and a sustainable environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Reusing by-products such as cow bones in agriculture can be achieved thorough pyrolysis. The potential of bone-derived biochar as a promising material for metals immobilization in contaminated mining soils has not yet been sufficiently explored. Therefore, cow bones were used as biochar feedstock were pyrolyzed at 500 °C (CBL) and 800 °C (CBH) and. The two biochars were applied to a mine contaminated soil at 0 (control), 2.5, 5 and 10%, w/w, dosages; then, the soils were incubated and cultivated by maize in the greenhouse. Cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) bioavailability and their sequentially extracted fractions (acid soluble, reducible, oxidizable, and residual fraction), soil microbial function, and plant health attributes were analyzed after maize harvesting. Bone-derived biochar enhanced the content of dissolved organic carbon (up to 74%), total nitrogen (up to 26%), and total phosphorus (up to 27%) in the soil and improved the plant growth up to 55%, as compared to the control. The addition of CBL altered the acid soluble fraction of both metals to the residual fraction and, thus, reduced the content of Zn (55 and 40%) and Cd (57 and 67%) in the maize roots and shoots, respectively as compared to the control. The CBL enhanced the β-glucosidase (51%) and alkaline phosphatase activities (71%) at the lower doses (2.5–5%) as compared to control, while the activities of these enzymes decreased with the higher application doses. Also, CBL improved the antioxidants activity and maize growth at the 2.5–5% application rate. However, the activity of the dehydrogenase significantly decreased (77%), particularly with CBH. We conclude that CBL, applied at 2.5–5% dose, can be utilized as a potential low cost and environmental friendly amendment for stabilization of toxic metals in contaminated mining soils and producing food/feed/biofuel crops with lower metal content. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Variations in lignocellulosic feedstock composition can influence conversion performance of bioethanol production, but such effects are overlooked in several studies that rely on standard conversion factors. This study investigates the effects of seven lignocellulosic feedstocks (belonging to the categories energy crops, forest and agricultural residues) on mass, carbon, water and energy balances for biochemical bioethanol production, including a comparison of individual process step yields. We find that overall bioethanol yields vary considerably, ranging between 19.0 and 29.0%, 27.3 and 46.2%, and 19.0 and 31.0%, for energy and carbon efficiency, respectively. The highest yields are found for switchgrass, which has the largest carbohydrate content, and the lowest for forest residues (spruce). Feedstock composition also affects water and carbon balances. Overall, the type of biomass influences conversion performances, thereby calling for explicit representation of the effects of biomass types in technical, economic and environmental assessment studies of bioethanol production. © 2021

AB  - Biobutanol is one of the most promising renewable biofuels, which can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass by Clostridium. However, due to the dense structure of lignin, biomass is difficult to be hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars. This study has developed a short time (90 min) and low energy consumption (120 °C) pretreatment process using deep eutectic solvent (DES). Importantly, the cellulose recovery of treated corn stover (CS) after DES pretreatment at 120 °C was 99.24 %, while the removal of xylan and lignin reached 57.58 % and 61.40 %, respectively. The total sugars released from treated CS at 120 °C reached 37.94 g L−1 (glucose: 30.59 g L−1; xylose: 7.35 g L−1) at a low enzyme loading of 7.5 filter paper unit (FPU) g−1 pretreated CS. Furthermore, the DES treated CS hydrolysate was successfully used to produce butanol by Clostridium beijerinckii P260 without any detoxification and sterilization, thus producing 13.65 g L-1 total acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) with a high productivity (0.68 g L-1 h−1) and yield (0.38 g g−1). Overall, the present work provides a new insight into the efficient application of DES systems in lignocellulose biomass biorefinery. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, eight seaweeds (five red, two brown and one green) were collected and evaluated for dual biodiesel and/or bioethanol production. The highest significant lipid and carbohydrate contents were recorded in the brown seaweed Dilophus fasciola (4.92 and 37.97%dw, respectively). Three routes were investigated, namely R1 and R2 for direct production of biodiesel and bioethanol, respectively, from the whole biomass, in addition to R3 representing the sequential biodiesel and bioethanol production. D. fasciola showed a biodiesel yield of 35.04 mg g−1 dw, composed mainly of C16-C18 fatty acids with a high saturation degree. All biodiesel characteristics complied with the recommended values of international standards. The maximum reducing sugar content (37.2 g L−1) and bioethanol productivity at 72 hours (0.165 g L−1 h−1) were recorded in the lipid-free biomass (R3), which were 16.3% and 27.9%, respectively, higher than that of R2. Therefore, a maximum estimated total energy output of 9.96 MJ kg−1 was recorded in R3, which represented 6-times and 28.3% higher than R1 and R2, respectively. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Improving biomass enzymatic saccharification is effective for crop straw utilization, whereas phytoremediation is efficient for trace metal elimination from polluted agricultural soil. Here, we found that the green proteins extracted from Amaranthus leaf tissue could act as active biosurfactant to remarkably enhance lignocellulose enzymatic saccharification for high bioethanol production examined in eight grassy and woody plants after mild chemical and green-like pretreatments were performed. Notably, this study estimated that total green proteins supply collected from one-hectare-land Amaranth plants could even lead to additional 6400–12,400 tons of bioethanol, being over 10-fold bioethanol yield higher than those of soybean seed proteins and chemical surfactant. Meanwhile, the Amaranth green proteins were characterized as a dominated biosorbent for multiple trace metals (Cd, Pb, As) adsorption, being 2.9–6 folds higher than those of its lignocellulose. The Amaranth plants were also assessed to accumulate much more trace metals than all other plants as previously examined from large-scale contaminated soils. Furthermore, the Amaranth green proteins not only effectively block lignin to release active cellulases for the mostly enhanced biomass hydrolyzes, but also efficiently involve in multiple chemical bindings with Cd, which should thus address critical issues of high-costly biomass waste utilization and low-efficient trace metal remediation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The simultaneous ethanol production and removal during sequential cell recycle fed batch fermentation provides a complementary route to produce this biofuel from sugar mixtures, which may greatly improve yields and productivity from lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Spathaspora passalidarum is a wild-type strain able to naturally convert glucose, fructose, xylose and arabinose into ethanol. Therefore, the present work has focused on 2G bioethanol production by S. passalidarum aiming at the consumption of all sugars released after pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse in a single fermentation step. The fermentation strategy with sequential cell recycle, fed-batch mode and ethanol removal in situ was performed on a hemicellulosic hydrolysate medium supplemented with molasses. This strategy gave improved fermentation performance and enabled the co-fermention of all sugars under microaerobic conditions. The maximum ethanol yield and productivity was 0.482 g.g−1 and 9.5 g·L-1·h−1, respectively, showing a process efficiency of 94.3%. The selective ethanol removal enables the operation of the bioreactor at low levels of ethanol (20–30 g·L-1), even with high sugar concentration inputs, accelerating the fermentation performance and avoiding inhibitory effects on yeast metabolism. Applying the cell recycle strategy, S. passalidarum was able to increase its robustness, as shown by a 10-fold increase in ethanol productivity, and it was also able to tolerate a high acetic acid concentration (4.5 g·L-1) during long-term fermentations. These results demonstrate that the bioprocess strategy has a strong potential to improve bioethanol production of rich mixed sugar from lignocellulosic hydrolysates in a single fermentation step. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and climatic changes has triggered the researchers' attention to find an alternative and renewable energy source. Thus, biodiesel has been recognized as a potential alternative to petrodiesel for its biodegradability, non-toxicity, and environment-friendly attributes. In this study, an efficient and recyclable Cu–Ni doped ZrO2 catalyst was synthesized and used to produce biodiesel from a novel non-edible caper (Capparis spinosa L.) seed oil. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by x-ray diffraction, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The catalyst was reused in four consecutive transesterification reactions without losing any significant catalytic efficiency. Transesterification reaction conditions were optimized via response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design for predicting optimum biodiesel yields by drawing 3D surface plots. Maximum biodiesel yield of 90.2% was obtained under optimal operating conditions of 1:6 M ratio of oil to methanol, reaction temperature of 70 °C, reaction time of 1.5 h, and 2.5% catalyst loading. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C) analysis confirmed the high quality of biodiesel produced from non-edible caper (Capparis spinosa L.) seed oil. The fuel properties of the produced biodiesel were also found, such as kinematic viscosity (4.17 cS T), density (0.8312 kg/L), flash point (72 °C), acid no (0.21 mgKOH/g) and sulphur content (0.00042 wt%). These properties were matched and are in close agreement with the International Biodiesel Standards of European Union (EU-14214), China GB/T 20,828 (2007), and American (ASTM6751). Thus, non-edible Capparis spinosa L. seed oil and Cu–Ni doped ZrO2 catalyst appeared to be highly active, stable, and cheap candidates to boost the future biodiesel industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, carbon-silica based acid catalysts derived from rice husks (RH) were successfully synthesised using microwave (MW) technology. The results showed that MW sulphonation produced Sulphur (S) content of 17.2–18.5 times higher than in raw RH. Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) showed peak at 1035 cm−1 which corresponded to O˭S˭O stretching of sulphonic (-SO3H) group. XRD showed sulfonated RH catalysts (SRHCs) have amorphous structure, and through SEM, broadening of the RH voids and also formation of pores is observed. RH600 had the highest surface area of 14.52 m2/g. SRHCs showed high catalytic activity for esterification of oleic acid with methanol with RH600 had the highest initial formation rate (6.33 mmol L−1 min−1) and yield (97%). The reusability of the catalyst showed gradually dropped yield of product for every recycle, which might be due to leaching of –SO3H. Finally, esterification of oil recovered from palm oil mill effluent (POME) with methanol achieved a conversion of 87.3% free fatty acids (FFA) into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). © 2020

AB  - Microalgae have been accepted as a potential feedstock for biofuel production due to their high oil content and rapid biomass production. In this study, deoiled Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) was used for evaluating whether deoiled algal biomass residue is potential as an alternative energy resource for bio-ethanol production with different heterogeneous catalysts. The SO biomass was examined for its physiochemical properties and also evaluated using FTIR, XRD, and TGA techniques. The successful hydrolysis of SO was performed employing different eco-friendly bio-based heterogeneous catalysts and hydrolysate thus obtained was then subjected to fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand was analyzed through HPLC and GC which resulted in the production of bio-ethanol with the highest yield of 68.32 % at 8.24 g/L concentration. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Lipid-accumulating microalgae are an emerging feedstock for production of liquid biofuel because of their high biomass and lipid productivity. The potential of the green microalgae, Chlorolobion sp. (BIOTECH 4031) and Chlorella sp. (BIOTECH 4026), for biodiesel production was evaluated by analyzing the effect of nitrogen starvation (0.375–1.500 g L−1 NaNO3) on growth response, oil yield, and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles of the two algal strains. Maximum biomass yields for Chlorolobion sp. and Chlorella sp. were obtained after 20 days of cultivation using the control medium (1.5 g L−1 NaNO3) with 0.873 g L−1 and 0.757 g L−1, respectively. An increasing trend in the total lipid yield was observed under a nitrogen-starved culture condition (0.375 g L−1 NaNO3). When the amount of nitrate was limited, the mean oil contents of Chlorolobion sp. and Chlorella sp. were 31.61 and 28.77% with lipid productivity of 227.84 and 151.14 mg L−1 day−1, respectively. Nitrogen starvation caused an increase in the lipid yield and a decrease in biomass production of the two microalgae. The FAME profile of the obtained algal biodiesel shows a high concentration of saturated fatty acid (SAFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) methyl esters which are desirable for biodiesel production. The fuel properties of biodiesel from the two microalgae were predicted based on the molecular properties of fatty acid methyl esters using empirical equations showing that the biodiesel properties of the two microalgae satisfied the set specifications of biodiesel standards EN 14214 (European) and ASTM D6751 (American). The quality properties of biodiesel obtained for Chlorolobion sp. were low density (0.89 g cm−3), low kinematic viscosity (2.79 mm2 s−1), cetane number (65.17), and oxidation stability (8.93 h). On the other hand, Chlorella sp. has low density (0.88 g cm−3), low kinematic viscosity (2.78 mm2 s−1), good cetane number (68.79), and oxidation stability (10.44 h). Hence, Chlorolobion sp. (BIOTECH 4031) and Chlorella sp. (BIOTECH 4026) have potential as raw material for production of biodiesel with superior fuel quality. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Sugarcane is the second largest bioenergy crop in the world and it accounts for 80% of global sugar production. Grown mostly in wet and warm tropics with relatively high nitrogen (N) fertiliser input and crop residue retention, sugarcane production is a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. Yet, a global evaluation of research on N2O emission from sugarcane crop is lacking. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis using data from 141 measurements compiled from 15 sugarcane field studies reported from different countries to i) quantify N2O emissions and emission factors (EFs) globally, and for tropics and sub-tropics, and ii) identify the key factors that promote N2O emission. Our analysis shows that the global mean total N2O emission from sugarcane production reached 2.26 (CI: 1.93–2.62) kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 with an estimated EF of 1.21% (CI: 0.971–1.46%). N2O emissions increased exponentially with increase in N fertiliser rate, questioning the adequacy of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default EF value (1%) for sugarcane N2O emission estimation. Mean total N2O emissions and EFs in tropics and sub-tropics did not vary significantly. Supplementing synthetic N fertiliser (SN) with organic amendments (OA) significantly increased mean N2O emission (~1.4-fold) and EF (~2.5-fold) compared to SN. A remarkable reduction in N2O emission (38.6%) and EF (61.5%) was evident when enhanced efficiency fertilisers (EEF) replaced SN. In contrast, crop residue removal had little impact on N2O emission and EF, but both parameters showed an upward trend with irrigation and increased rainfall. Soil carbon content and pH were emerged as key regulators of sugarcane N2O emission and EF. It is concluded that global sugarcane N2O emission could be significant and that there is considerable prospect for mitigating the emission through innovative nutrient formulations and precision agriculture that help meet crop nutrient demand without compromising environmental imperatives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Looking at the past decades, intense efforts have been made on one of the flourishing technology called biofuel cells with respect to the power or energy crisis prevailing all over the globe. Global researchers are taking part in the development of biofuels cells by exploiting novel characteristics of unconventional materials at atomic and molecule level like nanotubes (carbon nanotubes), nanosheets, nanoparticles, conducting polymers, etc in order to generate effective electricity from the substrates of biological origin via utilizing various biocatalysts. With the advancement in the field of nanotechnology, significant discoveries with respect to the field of biofuel cells have been accomplished. But till date, there has been a significant challenge regarding the performance and efficiency of the biofuels cells. Nowadays, to generate high power, an efficient and skillful approach which consists of the implementation of nano-based materials and conducting polymers with respect to the assembly of the biofuel cells is being considered by many researchers. Bioenergy and biofuels is a potential contestant for alternative fuel and with regard to this nanotechnology is one such significant weapon to synthesize and modify the production of biofuel and bio-energy. It has been assumed that in the near future with such extensive research biofuel cells will take up the economy of a nation in a sustainable way. This review gives the insights of biofuel cells and their types, brief synopsis of applications of the biofuel cells along with the scrutiny of biofuel cells in the market. Significant discussions have been provided in this review relating to the nanomaterials being employed as an electrode in biofuel cells. Certain examples have been mentioned to justify the concept of biofuel cell nanodevices following the ethical considerations of the same. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is one of the world's most abundant agricultural residues and in an Indian context, ∼100 million tonnes per annum is produced. The current use of SCB is restricted to the cogeneration of steam and power; however considering its potential, cogeneration is not the best valorisation route. Furthermore, with falling electricity prices and reducing global sugar prices due to excess sugar stock, it is inevitable that the waste generated (SCB) by sugar mills are utilised for generating revenue sustainably. With this background, this review aims to put forth a biorefinery perspective based on SCB feedstock. Biogas and bioethanol are the Government of India's current focus with policies and subsidies clearly pointing towards a sizeable future market. Therefore, alongside these biofuels, high-value chemicals such as xylitol, succinic acid and lactic acid were identified as other desired products for biorefineries. This review firstly discusses SCB pre-treatment options based on end applications (saccharification or anaerobic digestion, AD). Next, state-of-the-art for each of these aspects was reviewed and our perspective on a profitable biorefinery is presented. We propose an AD based biorefinery where vortex-based hydrodynamic cavitation was found to be the best choice for pre-treatment. AD is considered not only a bioprocess for energy production here but also a 'pre-treatment', where partial conversion of holocellulose leads to a digestate rich in a loosened fibre matrix. This digestate rich in cellulose can be enzymatically hydrolysed and further valorised biochemically. This approach would be cost effective and provide a sustainable waste management route for sugar mills. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Grass cell walls have hydroxycinnamic acids attached to arabinosyl residues of arabinoxylan (AX), and certain BAHD acyltransferases are involved in their addition. In this study, we characterized one of these BAHD genes in the cell wall of the model grass Setaria viridis. RNAi silenced lines of S. viridis (SvBAHD05) presented a decrease of up to 42% of ester-linked p-coumarate (pCA) and 50% of pCA-arabinofuranosyl, across three generations. Biomass from SvBAHD05 silenced plants exhibited up to 32% increase in biomass saccharification after acid pre-treatment, with no change in total lignin. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that SvBAHD05 is a p-coumaroyl coenzyme A transferase (PAT) mainly involved in the addition of pCA to the arabinofuranosyl residues of AX in Setaria. Thus, our results provide evidence of p-coumaroylation of AX promoted by SvBAHD05 acyltransferase in the cell wall of the model grass S. viridis. Furthermore, SvBAHD05 is a promising biotechnological target to engineer crops for improved biomass digestibility for biofuels, biorefineries and animal feeding. © 2020 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Cellulosic biofuel is considered a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Currently, the commercialization of cellulosic biofuel is proceeding at a slower pace than expected due to the high cost of the cellulosic biofuel supply chain (CBSC), especially in the manufacturing process. In this paper, a new model for a four-echelon CBSC incorporating 12 conversion pathways is proposed to minimize total supply chain cost by considering multiple time periods, various biomass types and spatial distributions, biomass and biofuel inventories, logistics, and different demand levels. Case studies from the state of Illinois in the U.S. are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. It is manifested that the model can select appropriate conversion pathways for biorefineries given the abundance of local resources to minimize the overall cost. Compared to the two cases adopted a single conversion pathway, the optimal result achieves 14.6% and 4.6% reductions on the unit biofuel cost, respectively. In addition, the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the biorefinery construction cost and the biofuel throughput are the main economic drivers in the current supply chain design. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Screening of high temperature tolerant strains is important for photo-fermentative hydrogen production in natural conditions which exhibit wide temperature variations. Hence, a temperature-tolerant strain of Rhodobacter capsulatus was isolated by transposon mutagenesis. The mutant strain Rhodobacter capsulatus MX01 could convert cornstalk hydrolysate into hydrogen successfully, and exhibited better hydrogen production performance at higher culture temperature (33 °C and 37 °C) and light intensity (5000 lx and 7000 lx) than the wild type strain. At 33 °C and 5000 lx, the total hydrogen production yield and rate of MX01 from cornstalk hydrolysate were 3.64 ± 0.18 mol-H2/g-cornstalk and 40.07 ± 1.70 mmol-H2/(h·g-cornstalk), respectively. The energy conversion efficiency of cornstalk hydrolysate to hydrogen for the mutant strain MX01 was 10.6%. This higher temperature- and light intensity-tolerant mutant MX01 could carry out photo-fermentation at outdoor settings, which is important for eco-friendly, low-cost and energy-saving practical application of bio-hydrogen production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Empty fruit bunches (EFB) have low biodegradability and restrict their commercial utilization in biogas plants. Integration of straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea) cultivation as a function of bio-pretreatment on EFB to improve biodegradability and methane production by solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) was investigated. The mushroom yield was 47.3 kg·tonne−1 EFB with remaining weight in spent mushroom-EFB (S-mEFB) of 82%. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin of EFB were degraded by 3.3%, 21.3%, and 17.6%, respectively, with an increased surface area of S-mEFB. The biodegradability of S-mEFB (62.7%) was 2 times higher than raw EFB (33.5%) with the highest methane yield and production of 281 mL CH4·g−1 VS and 50.6 m3·tonne−1 S-mEFB, respectively. The co-digestion of S-mEFB with 5% v/w POME had highest methane yield of 405 mL CH4·g−1 VS with biodegradability of 90.8%. Integrating straw mushroom cultivation with SS-AD is a promising strategy for achieving an environmentally friendly and economically feasible process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Textile industry represents one prevalent activity worldwide, generating large amounts of highly contaminated and rich in azo dyes wastewater, with severe effects on natural ecosystems and public health. However, an effective and environmentally friendly treatment method has not yet been implemented, while concurrently, the increasing demand of modern societies for adequate and sustainable energy supply still remains a global challenge. Under this scope, the purpose of the present study was to isolate promising species of yeasts inhabiting wood-feeding termite guts, for combined azo dyes and textile wastewater bioremediation, along with biodiesel production. Results: Thirty-eight yeast strains were isolated, molecularly identified and subsequently tested for desired enzymatic activity, lipid accumulation, and tolerance to lignin-derived metabolites. The most promising species were then used for construction of a novel yeast consortium, which was further evaluated for azo dyes degradation, under various culture conditions, dye levels, as well as upon the addition of heavy metals, different carbon and nitrogen sources, and lastly agro-waste as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly substrate alternative. The novel yeast consortium, NYC-1, which was constructed included the manganese-dependent peroxidase producing oleaginous strains Meyerozyma caribbica, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Vanrija humicola, and showed efficient azo dyes decolorization, which was further enhanced depending on the incubation conditions. Furthermore, enzymatic activity, fatty acid profile and biodiesel properties were thoroughly investigated. Lastly, a dye degradation pathway coupled to biodiesel production was proposed, including the formation of phenol-based products, instead of toxic aromatic amines. Conclusion: In total, this study might be the first to explore the application of MnP and lipid-accumulating yeasts for coupling dye degradation and biodiesel production. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The present study attempts to integrate phyco-remediation and enhanced lipid productivity using microalgae-bacterial consortium enriched from wastewater fed aquaculture pond. Metagenomic analyses and microscopic images of the consortium revealed the presence of Chlorella variabilis, Parachlorella kessleri, Thermosynechococcus elongatus, Chlamydomonas, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Oscillatoriales, Synechocystis sp., Microcystis aeruginosa, Nostocales, Naviculales, Stramenopiles, other members of Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, and Chroococcales along with potential bacterial bioremediants. During a 30 days trial run (15 days stabilization and 14 days remediation studies) for phyco-remediation drastic reduction in the nutrient and COD content from the tested wastewater samples was seen. There was up to 93% and 87.2% reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium concentration, respectively. Further, almost 100% removal of nitrates and phosphates from the dairy wastewater upon 48 h of treatment with polyculture under ambient temperature (25 ± 2 °C) with 6309 lux illumination and mild aeration, was observed for all the seven cycles. Interestingly, the nutrient and COD concentrations in the treated water were below the discharge standards as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) norms. In additions, biomass (reported as dry cell weight) was enhanced by 67% upon treatment with ammonia-rich dairy wastewater exhibiting 42% lipid, 55% carbohydrate, and 18.6% protein content enhancement. The polyculture mainly grown as attached biofilm to the surface, offered an easy harvesting and separation of grown biomass from the treated wastewater. Overall, dairy wastewater was found to be a potential nutrient source for microalgae-bacteria cultivation thereby making the treatment process sustainable and eco-friendly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research investigation, three microalgal species were screened (Pleurosigma sp., Amphora sp., and Amphiprora sp.) for lipid content before choosing the potential microalgae for biodiesel production. It was found that the lipid content of Amphiprora sp. was 41.48 ± 0.18%, which was higher than the Pleurosigma sp. (27.3 ± 0.8%) and Amphora sp. (22.49 ± 0.21%). The diatom microalga, Amphiprora sp. was isolated and exposed to a controlled environment. Two different media were prepared, and the main research was on the SiO2-NP medium as the cell wall of diatom was made up of silica. Essential growth parameters were studied such as dry cell weight and chlorophyll a content. The results revealed that Amphiprora sp. cultured in the modified medium showed a higher biomass yield and growth rate in all the analyses. In Soxhlet extraction method, biodiesel yield of Amphiprora sp. in modified medium under 24 μmol m−2 s−1 of light intensity was 81.47 ± 1.59% when using 2% of catalyst amount with 1.5:1 volume ratio of methanol/oil in 3 h reaction time at 65 °C. Results reveled that Amphiprora sp. diatom has a higher yield of oil 52.94 ± 0.42% and can be efficiently optimized with further studies with modified nanomaterial culture medium. The present research revealed the series of experiments on microalgal lipid transesterification and in future investigation different types of nanomaterials should be used in culture medium to identify the lipid production in microalgal cells. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new heterogeneous biochar/CaO/K2CO3 catalyst was fabricated to produce biodiesel from waste edible oil. In this catalyst, the biochar was produced from brown algae of Sargassum oligocystum and CaO from eggshells. The XRD result showed that the biochar, CaO, and synthesized catalyst have a crystalline structure. Response surface methodology-central composite design (RSM-CCD) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to investigate the effect of parameters and determine optimal conditions. Also, the maximum efficiency of biodiesel production (98.83%) was predicted by the RSM-CCD method at 65 °C, 4 wt% catalyst content, 200 min duration, and 18: 1 methanol to oil ratio. The process of biodiesel production was exothermic. The activation energy and frequency factor were calculated 45.53 kJ/mol and 6.03 × 10+4 min−1, respectively. Biodiesel properties were evaluated according to international standards (ASTM D6751 and EN14214). The catalyst was reused for up to 90% efficiency in up to 5 steps. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For degradation of sugarcane bagasse (SCB), several enzymes are needed but β-glucosidase is rate limiting in cellulose hydrolysis. Since different microorganisms synthetize characteristic pool of enzymes, mixing extracts produced by different species may increase hydrolytic efficiency due to synergism between enzymes in cocktails. This paper reports the study of β-glucosidase production in solid state cultivation (SSC) of two filamentous fungi, thermophilic Thermoascus aurantiacus and mesophilic Trichoderma reesei, and application of the enzymatic extracts on non-pretreated SCB saccharification. Enzyme extract obtained from the thermophilic fungus presented higher β-glucosidase and FPU activities (1.8 U/mL and 10 FPU/mL) than the one from mesophilic (0.2 U/mL and 6 FPU/mL). Optimal SCB hydrolysis was achieved when applying enzymatic cocktail composed of equal volumes of both fungal extracts (3.6 FPU/gSCB, filter paper units per gram SCB, 2.25 FPU/gSCB provided by extract from T. aurantiacus and 1.35 FPU/gSCB from T. reesei) at 65 °C. The hydrolysis yield applying the enzyme cocktail, 124 mg total reducing sugars (TRS) per gSCB, was higher than any yield achieved when using the enzyme extracts separately (105 mgTRS/gSCB using 12.5 FPU per gSCB from T. aurantiacus at 65 °C; 79 mgTRS/gSCB using 7.5 FPU per gSCB from T. reesei at 45 °C). Therefore, the use of the cocktail (3.6 FPU/gSCB) at 65 °C released 18 and 57% more TRS respectively than when extracts from T. aurantiacus or from T. reesei were applied alone, respectively, even reducing enzyme load (FPU) by 70%, corroborating the synergistic effect when both extracts are used together. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Reduction of CO2 to acetate in microbial electrosynthesis has been widely studied. However, the selective and quantitative production of longer chain chemicals and biofuels is still a bottleneck. Lack of sufficient energy provided by only the cathode electrode in Bio-electrochemical systems during chain elongation is one of the key challenges. It is assumed that additional electron donors than a polarised cathode is required to steer the production towards longer chain of carboxylates than acetate. In this study, formate and ethanol were supplied separately in the reactors fed by CO2 for 45 days in addition to the cathodes poised at −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl to investigate their effect on production. Although acetate was still the major product, supplying electron donors directed the production towards more diverse and longer chain organic chemicals than that in presence of the polarised cathode only. Significant improvement in the production of butyrate (×3.8 increase in maximum concentration) and butanol (maximum of 6.8 ± 0.3 mmol C L−1) was observed after supplying formate, while ethanol increased the diversity of the products. Supplying formate and ethanol in reactors for another 30 days under open circuit potential clarified that only ethanol could provide sufficient energy for butyrate production from acetate in the absence of polarised cathode, which reached the highest butyrate concentration of 19.1 ± 2.3 mmol C L−1. Formate was only consumed in presence of polarised cathode. It is proposed in our study that production of C4 products in presence of only cathodic electrode or cathodic electrode and formate could be associated to initial reduction of acetate to ethanol, consumed for production of C4 products through acetate. Trace levels of caproate and hexanol were detected in both reactors supplied with formate and ethanol only in the presence of polarised cathode. © 2020

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of animal manure show a maximum of ca. 50% conversion of volatile solids due to recalcitrance of lignin and crystalline cellulose under anaerobic conditions. The aim of this study is to evaluate different pretreatments on anaerobic digestion of manure fibers after anaerobic digestion. Physical, chemical, thermal, and thermal combined with alkaline pretreatments using sodium hydroxide were tested on manure fiber fraction separated out after anaerobic digestion of cow manure. The anaerobic digestion after pretreatment along with untreated controls were done in semi-continuous anaerobic bioreactors. All pretreatments showed positive effect and the highest increase in VS conversion (42.4%) and methane yield (ca. 127%) was found for 3% NaOH pretreated sample at 180 °C. Composition analysis showed that cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in digested manure fibers were optimally reduced by 24.8, 29.1 and 9.5% respectively during pretreatment and 76.5% of cellulose and 84.9% of hemicellulose was converted to methane during AD. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - On-site monitoring of L-cysteine (L-Cys) has great significance for clinical diagnosis. In this study, a portable, fast, and ultrasensitive self-powered biosensor based on the single-chamber glucose/air enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) is proposed for the detection of L-Cys. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and ultrathin hollow carbon shells (UHCS) were prepared and used as the biocathode and bioanode base material of EBFC, respectively. The electron transfer rate of the enzyme and electrode was enhanced by using a carbon paper (CP) electrode base modified with UHCS/AuNPs. DNA1/UHCS/AuNPs/CP was used as the biocathode of the self-powered biosensor where DNA1 was fixed on the electrode surface by Au–N bond, and the bioanode was obtained by loading laccase on the polydopamine film-modified substrate electrode. AuNP-decorated N-doped graphene was synthesized and immobilized with DNA2 modified with glucose oxidase (GOD) to form a bioconjugate. Due to the Ag+-mediated hybridization of DNA1 and DNA2, a C–Ag+–C complex will be formed, and the bioconjugate could bind to the bioanode. The reaction of glucose catalyzed by GOD can release electrons and result in the significant open-circuit voltage (EOCV) of the biosensor due to the reduction reaction occurred on the cathode. . When L-Cys is present, L-Cys forms an insoluble thiolate with Ag+. As a result, the conjugates are detached from the electrode surface, and the signal is significantly reduced. L-Cys can be detected in an expanded linear range of 0.01–5 μM with a detection limit of 2.20 nM. The developed self-powered biosensor exhibits high selectivity, outstanding reproducibility, and excellent stability for the detection of L-Cys in human urine samples. It can be used as a potential prototype for implantable and point-of-care diagnostic devices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the increasing demand for monitoring diseases such as rising heart rate, diabetes, and ocular disorders wearable and implantable biomedical devices seems too essential for patients not only in the hospital but also at home or during working time. Researchers mostly try to offer valuable information on the conditions of patients as non-invasive, by using comfort biomedical device with a minimum side effect. So, small and self-powered with high sensitivity biomedical devices are recommended, among different power sources that introduced for devices, biofuel cells would be produced as power source for a range of medical devices because of its capability to generate sufficient power output compared to the primary power source. The nature of the electrode reaction and the nature of the biochemical reactions are some of the important parameters that are considered for the classification of fuel cells. Enzymatic biofuel cells due to high activity at mild conditions widely applied in pacemaker; glucometer; and smart contact lenses when compared to other kinds of biofuel cells. On the other hand, short lifespan is one of important limitations in this type of biofuel cells. So, the easiest way to overcome these challenges is to apply non-enzymatic ones. Recent studies have attempted to issue novel method for fabrication of non-enzymatic biofuel cell in order to produce a new generation which are inexpensive, disposable, selective, and sensitive in properties. However, consideration of researchers to the development of self-powered biomedical devices by using body fluids or providing electricity storage is rising. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - A critical factor for the performance of a biofuel cell is an immobilization of the redox enzyme for continuous catalytic reaction and efficient electron transfer. However, the main obstacle associated with enzyme electrode is the reduced surface area for the accommodation of enzymes, leading to poor power output. This study aimed to optimize the efficient electrical communication for glucose oxidase (GOx) on the surface of a graphite oxide/cobalt hydroxide/chitosan composite as mediator, thereby enhancing the generation of power output. Immobilization efficiency was affected by the different concentrations of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Also, the surface of enzyme electrode was observed by XPS, Raman, and AFM, respectively. The electrochemical characterization showed that the immobilized GOx possesses the highest activity at EDC:NHS(40:80 mM) concentration. The power output under the optimal condition was found to be 2.24 mWcm−2 of power density using the three-electrode cell in 0.1 M PBS solution at room temperature. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are considered as a promising technology to sustain the requirements of miniaturized portable energy sources. Electrode materials being one of the substantial aspects of EBFCs have stimulated immense interest in research. A new platform made of nanocomposite, involving magnetic particles of iron oxide (Fe3O4), carbon nanotubes (CNT), gold nanoparticles (Au) and a conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy), was used as the electrode support for the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOD) which improves the bioelectrocatalysis of the enzyme towards oxidation of glucose. The structural and electrochemical characterization of the modified bioanode GCE/PPy/Au/CNT@Fe3O4/FRT/GOD was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The performance of the bioanode was evaluated with promising results showing the maximum current density of 6.01 mA cm−2 (0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in 40 mM of glucose concentration at 0.38 V open circuit potential (OCV). The results suggested that PPy/Au/CNT@Fe3O4 nanocomposite significantly improve the surface area of the electrode and served as a suitable environment for enzyme immobilization, and established good electrical communication by facilitating electron transfer between enzymes and electrode surface. The as-synthesized composite has been inferred as a promising platform for improved bioelectrocatalysis owing to the excellent combination of superparamagnetism of Fe3O4 with good electrocatalytic properties of CNT, PPy, and Au nanoparticles. Thus PPy/Au/CNT@Fe3O4 nanocomposite can be considered as a prospective electrode material for developing better electrochemical biosensors and biofuel cell anode. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Many investigations have introduced MgO as a favorable solid base catalyst. Although magnesium oxide catalyst does not have as strong of basic sites as calcium oxide catalyst, it is stable under ambient conditions. Furthermore, magnesium oxide catalyst activity is not sensitive to the water content of the reactants, which makes magnesium oxide catalyst possible for commercial purposes. In addition, the use of the non-magnetic catalyst could be facilely recovered by magnetic and reusable several times without a notable decrease in catalytic activity. In the present study, MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst was synthesized by precipitation method for biodiesel production. This nanocatalyst was characterized by different techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) to recognize functional groups, measurement magnetic characteristics by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), identification of the phase and crystalline structure of nanocatalysts using X-radiation (XRD) and a survey of morphology and surface properties by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then, the synthesized catalyst was utilized to synthesis biodiesel from the transesterification reaction of camelina seed oil with methyl alcohol. A high biodiesel efficiency (99 %) was obtained under optimized conditions using the central composite design (CCD) based on the response surface methodology (RSM). The optimization was carried out in two separate parts; the initial part focuses on the optimization of the variables affecting the catalytic performance and the second part includes optimizing the variables affecting the reaction conditions of biodiesel production. The biodiesel was examined by GC- Mass spectra and physicochemical characteristics such as viscosity and refractive index. The optimum performance was achieved over MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst at calcination time 2.29 h, calcination temperature 650 ͦ C, 55.25 % w/w MgO to Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst, methanol to oil molar ratio 12/1, the catalyst to oil weight ratio 4.9 % w/w, reaction temperature 70 ͦ C and reaction time 4.1 h. Moreover, MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst could be removed facilely from the reaction system by a magnet and catalytic performance maintained for the four reused cycles. Based on the results, camelina seed oil could be utilized as a promising alternative biofuel for impressive, renewable and green production of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Olive agro-industry is a chemical- and energy-intensive agricultural activity and given its large scale globally is faced with serious challenges from the sustainability perspective. On the other hand, different by-products and residues generated are not generally used and end up as wastes. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to design and implement innovative platforms based on circular bioeconomy and zero-discharge principles to enhance the sustainability features of the olive supply chain system. In light of that, the present study was aimed at designing and experimentally scrutinizing two olive agro-biorefinery scenarios against the conventional olive oil production system (i.e., olive/olive oil production, including olive cultivation and oil extraction). The first agro-biorefinery system included olive cultivation and oil extraction from fruit and pomace for edible use. Moreover, the remaining pomace post-oil extraction was used as an animal feed. The second agro-biorefinery system included olive cultivation, olive oil extraction, olive pomace oil extraction, and its conversion into biodiesel. In addition, crude biodiesel glycerol was also valorized into two different phosphate salts and an oxygenated fuel additive (namely triacetin), while olive oil leaves were converted into a natural antioxidant for biodiesel. The performance of the natural antioxidant against the most promising synthetic antioxidant used by the biodiesel industry (i.e., propyl gallate) was also investigated. The developed scenarios were environmentally compared using the IMPACT 2002+ method. Overall, both developed agro-biorefineries outperformed the conventional system in terms of all four endpoint damage categories. Compared to the conventional olive oil production system, the production of 1 ton of olive oil in the first and second agro-biorefinery systems was associated with 10.62% and 4.08% saving in climate change damage category, 6.73% and 11.21% saving in primary energy consumption, and 12.01% and 1.55% saving in damage to human health. In addition, the implementation of the circular bioeconomy approach in olive oil production led to 31.28% and 26.38% saving in ecosystem quality damage category for Sc-2 and Sc-3, respectively. Overall, the weighted endpoint damage categories of olive oil production could be saved by 12.27% and 4.49% if respectively, the first and second agro-biorefinery scenarios were used. These findings revealed that through the transition from linear economy-oriented olive agri-food system to a bioeconomy-oriented olive agro-biorefinery, not only a wide spectrum of value-added bioproducts could be achieved, but also the environmental impacts per each ton of olive oil produced could be mitigated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pre-treatment and pelletisation of oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) can potentially improve its biofuel properties for efficient thermal energy recovery. Therefore, this paper examines the physicochemical, thermal, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties of OPEFB pellets as a potential feedstock for pyrolysis. Physicochemical analysis revealed high proportions of carbon, volatiles, and fixed carbon compared to nitrogen and sulphur. Morphological analysis showed that the pellet microstructure is comprised of a dense network of polymeric fibres, whereas its ash has consistently shaped agglomerated particles with fine-textured surfaces. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed the OPEFB pellets experienced significant mass loss (ML = 72.8–80.4%) and residual mass (RM = 19.6–27.2%) during thermal decomposition from 30 to 800 °C. The DTG plots revealed thermal decomposition occurred in three stages: I (30–150 °C), II (150–600 °C), and III (600–800 °C) due to drying, devolatilization, and char degradation, respectively. Kinetic analysis showed the activation energy, Ea, ranged from 76.87 to 195.78 kJ/mol, while frequency factor, A, was from 4.77 × 1001 to 1.22 × 1018 min−1 for the Flynn-Wall Ozawa and Kissinger-Akahira Sunose models. The highest kinetic parameters were observed at α = 0.40, indicating the rate-determining step for OPEFB pellets decomposition under pyrolysis condition occurs at 40% conversion. Thermodynamic analysis showed that thermal decomposition of OPEFB pellets was characterised by the formation of an activated complex, high reactive multiphase first-order reactions, and short reaction times. In conclusion, the results indicate that OPEFB pellets is a potentially suitable feedstock for pyrolysis owing to its excellent fuel properties and environmentally friendly nature. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the effort to manage global warming and fossil carbon emissions, many countries are suggesting brand-new policies to make their energy matrix much more renewable. The boost share of bioethanol as a transportation fuel becomes a short-term option since its production technology is fully grown and combined with gasoline. The 2nd generation ethanol still has involvement on the planet biofuels circumstance. In this study, water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) fresh and dry biomass applied with alkalis (NaOH) and acid (H2SO4) were combined to pretreat the abundant free-floating aquatic plant water lettuce biomass. Naturally, the water lettuce accumulates food in the form of starch, suitable for bioethanol production. The results showed that the highest total sugar (11.350 ± 0.09%), reducing sugar (4.773 ± 0.15%), and ethanol (15. 385 g/L) were obtained after pretreatment of dried water lettuce with cellulase. Consequently, water lettuce was high feasible for sustainable bioethanol production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a widely applied technology for treating organic wastes to generate renewable energy in the form of biogas. The effectiveness of AD process depends on many factors, among which the most important is the presence of active and healthy microbial community in the anaerobic digesters, which needs to be explored. However, the deciphering of microbial populations and their functions during the AD process of different materials is still incomplete, which restricts the understanding of its long-term performance under different operational conditions. This review describes the type, morphology, functions, and specific growth conditions of commonly found hydrolytic, acidogenic, acetogenic bacteria, and archaea during the AD process. The effects of microbes on the performance and stability of the digestion process are also presented. Furthermore, the article offers a deep understanding of the AD management strategies for the enhancement of methane production and the efficiency of the energy conversion process of various organic wastes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of bulk chemicals mostly depends on exhausting petroleum sources and leads to emission of greenhouse gases. Within the last decades the urgent need for alternative sources has increased and the development of bio-based processes received new attention. To avoid the competition between the use of sugars as food or fuel, other feedstocks with high availability and low cost are needed, which brought acetogenic bacteria into focus. This group of anaerobic organisms uses mixtures of CO2, CO and H2 for the production of mostly acetate and ethanol. Also methanol, a cheap and abundant bulk chemical produced from methane, is a suitable substrate for acetogenic bacteria. In methylotrophic acetogens the methyl group is transferred to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, a pathway to reduce CO2 to acetate via a series of C1-intermediates bound to tetrahydrofolic acid. Here we describe the biochemistry and bioenergetics of methanol conversion in the biotechnologically interesting group of anaerobic, acetogenic bacteria. Further, the bioenergetics of biochemical production from methanol is discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Construction of a multipurpose yeast consortium suitable for lipid production, textile dye/effluent removal and lignin valorization is critical for both biorefinery and bioremediation. Therefore, a novel oleaginous consortium, designated as OYC-Y.BC.SH has been developed using three yeast cultures viz. Yarrowia sp. SSA1642, Barnettozyma californica SSA1518 and Sterigmatomyces halophilus SSA1511. The OYC-Y.BC.SH was able to grow on different carbon sources and accumulate lipids, with its highest lipid productivity (1.56 g/L/day) and lipase activity (170.3 U/mL) exhibited in xylose. The total saturated fatty acid content was 36.09 %, while the mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acids were 45.44 and 18.30 %, respectively, making OYC-Y.BC.SH valuable for biodiesel production. The OYC-Y.BC.SH showed its highest decolorization efficiency of Red HE3B dye (above 82 %) in presence of sorghum husk as agricultural co-substrate, suggesting its feasibility for simultaneous lignin valorization. The significant higher performance of OYC-Y.BC.SH on decolorizing the real dyeing effluent sample at pH 8.0 suggests its potential and suitability for degrading most of the wastewater textile effluents. Clearly, toxicological studies underline the additional advantage of using OYC-Y.BC.SH for bioremediation of industrial dyeing effluents in terms of decolorization and detoxification. A possible mechanism of Red HE3B biodegradation and ATP synthesis was also proposed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This review aims to encourage the technical development of microbial biodiesel production from industrial-organic-wastes-derived volatile fatty acids (VFAs). To this end, this article summarizes the current status of several key technical steps during microbial biodiesel production, including (1) acidogenic fermentation of bio-wastes for VFA collection, (2) lipid accumulation in oleaginous microorganisms, (3) microbial lipid extraction, (4) transesterification of microbial lipids into crude biodiesel, and (5) crude biodiesel purification. The emerging membrane-based bioprocesses such as electrodialysis, forward osmosis and membrane distillation, are promising approaches as they could help tackle technical challenges related to the separation and recovery of VFAs from the fermentation broth. The genetic engineering and metabolic engineering approaches could be applied to design microbial species with higher lipid productivity and rapid growth rate for enhanced fatty acids synthesis. The enhanced in situ transesterification technologies aided by microwave, ultrasound and supercritical solvents are also recommended for future research. Technical limitations and cost-effectiveness of microbial biodiesel production from bio-wastes are also discussed, in regard to its potential industrial development. Based on the overview on microbial biodiesel technologies, an integrated biodiesel production line incorporating all the critical technical steps is proposed for unified management and continuous optimization for highly efficient biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dependence on fossil fuels for meeting the growing energy demand is damaging the world’s environment. There is a dire need to look for alternative fuels that are less potent to greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels offer several advantages with less harmful effects on the environment. Biodiesel is synthesized from the organic wastes produced extensively like edible, non-edible, microbial, and waste oils. This study reviews the feasibility of the state-of-the-art feedstocks for sustainable biodiesel synthesis such as availability, and capacity to cover a significant proportion of fossil fuels. Biodiesel synthesized from oil crops, vegetable oils, and animal fats are the potential renewable carbon-neutral substitute to petroleum fuels. This study concludes that waste oils with higher oil content including waste cooking oil, waste palm oil, and algal oil are the most favorable feedstocks. The comparison of biodiesel production and parametric analysis is done critically, which is necessary to come up with the most appropriate feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. Since the critical comparison of feedstocks along with oil extraction and biodiesel production technologies has never been done before, this will help to direct future researchers to use more sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel synthesis. This study concluded that the use of third-generation feedstocks (wastes) is the most appropriate way for sustainable biodiesel production. The use of innovative costless oil extraction technologies including supercritical and microwave-assisted transesterification method is recommended for oil extraction. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuel cells (BFCs)-based self-powered biosensors suffer from the limited stability of bioenzymes. Meanwhile, the poor performance of self-powered biosensors affects the sensitivity of biosensing, thus, it is significant and challenging to improve their stability and sensitivity. In our work, a BFC-based self-powered biosensor, with simultaneously enhanced stability and sensitivity, was constructed utilizing dual metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the carriers of the bioenzyme and the electroactive probe, respectively. Anodic enzyme, glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), was encapsulated in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) to form GDH@ZIF-8 composites, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of GDH. Meanwhile, another zirconium metal-organic frameworks (UiO-66-NH2) loaded with electroactive molecules (K3[Fe(CN)6]) served as nano-enrichment carriers and improved the capability of the cathode to accept electrons from the anode, further improving the sensitivity of the as-proposed biosensor. Herein, the “signal-on” BFC-based self-powered biosensing of exosomes, the model analyte, with excellent stability and outstanding sensitivity was realized with the assistance of dual MOFs, and the detection limit was down to 300 particles mL−1 (based on 3s/k), which was superior to those previously reported in literatures. Furthermore, the developed protocol was capable of detecting exosomes derived from cancer cells in complex biological samples. Overall, in this work the enhancement of both stability and sensitivity has been achieved by utilizing two types of MOFs, which laid the foundation for expanding the applications of BFC-based self-powered biosensors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The human population blast has brought several problems related with the overconsumption of a wide range of feedstocks and natural resources conducting to their risk of depletion. The consumption of fossil fuels is an example, with increasing levels of exploitation and negative impacts caused by their use. Anthropogenic activities have triggered the over accumulation of many hazardous substances and wastes which are regarded to be detrimental to life in the Earth and to the various planet ecosystems. There is an urgent need to restore natural resources and unwanted residues and wastes to levels prior the demographic explosion. Microalgal biotechnology appears to be pivotal to achieve this goal in a near future to come. This review presents the current resource problems affecting the Earth and how microalgae are expected to be an important part of the solution, discussing how the production of renewable energy from microalgae can help in an integrated way to mitigate different environmental problems. Microalgae are able to convert wastewaters, CO2 and organic residues in marketable biomass for different uses, including biofuels, converting waste in value. An inventory of current microalgal-based biorefineries in operation as well as a directory of companies, products and applications are also presented. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal processing is an interesting biorefinery technology for converting lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels and biocompounds. This process is based on the selective solubilization and depolymerization of hemicellulose fraction (xylan) and may be considered beneficial, due to the possibility of obtaining xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with a degree of polymerization (DP) suitable for prebiotic applications. This study evaluated the effect of pressure (2.5 and 10 MPa) in a kinetic study (30 min) of hydrothermal treatment (180 °C) to optimize the extraction of XOS from mango seed shell. Total reducing sugars (TRS) values were close to the maximum in 15 min showing a slower rate for both pressures after this time, but at 10 MPa the value was 20 % lower than at 2.5 MPa. Based on these results, a new extraction was performed at 2.5 MPa and 15 min, and the extracted XOS were quantified, yielding 393.44 mg XOS/g xylan. XOS with a degree of polymerization between X2-X6 corresponded to 82.24 mg/g and XOS with X > 6 (or soluble xylan) corresponded to 311.20 mg/g. A low amount of xylose (8.81 mg/g xylan) was released, resulting in a hemicellulose conversion of 40.2 %. In general, approximately 8.1 kg of total XOS was produced from 100 kg of dried mango seed shell (X2-X6−1.7 kg and X > 6–6.4 kg). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Paper and pulp mills generate substantial quantities of cellulose-rich sludge materials that are disposed in landfills at a large scale. For sustainability purposes, sludge materials can be bioprocessed to produce renewable fuels and useful chemicals. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is the process bottleneck that affects the conversion economics directly by using zero-cost raw materials. In order to study and optimize the process, the characteristics of the sludge raw materials should be first evaluated. In this work, sludge samples were obtained from paper mills located at different locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Part of the sludge samples was washed (de-ashed) with hydrochloric acid while the other part remained unwashed. The samples were subjected to multiple spectroscopic analyses techniques to evaluate the morphological properties of cellulose fibers and to estimate the total structural carbohydrate content. The results showed that the de-ashing process changed some fiber characteristics and cellulose crystallinity structure in all sludge samples. Sludge sample A (obtained from Kraft pulp and recycled paper mill region) showed a high percentage of fiber, with crystalline cellulose, compared to the other two sludge samples suggesting that sludge A is a valuable source to make value-added products. Aspen Plus mass and energy calculations performed in view of the ‘zero’ cost and the reliable supply of sludge raw materials producing 2 mol H2/mol glucose. Moreover, the results showed that extracting crystalline cellulose from these sludge samples is more profitable than crystalline cellulose made from the other lignocellulosic feedstocks. The results reported here showed that the utilization of these sludge materials would be an economically attractive and promising alternative for the production of hydrogen. © 2020

AB  - Purpose: To avoid a negative environmental and economic impact of agricultural wastes, and following the principles of circular economy, the reuse of agricultural wastes is necessary. For this purpose, isolation of novel microorganisms with potential biotechnological application is recommended. The current researches in bioethanol production are aimed to reduce the production costs using low-cost substrates and in-house produced enzymes by novel isolated microorganisms. In line with this, in this study valorization of these agricultural by-products by novel isolate S. fulvissimus CKS7 to biotechnological value added products was done. Methods: Standard microbiological methods were used for the isolation and characterization of strain. Enzymes activities were determinated using DNS method while, the ethanol concentration was determined based on the density of the alcohol distillate at 20 °C. Results: The maximal enzymatic activities for amylase, cellulases (carboxymethyl cellulase and Avicelase), pectinase and xylanase were achieved using rye bran as a waste substrate for CKS7 growth. Obtained crude bacterial enzymes were used for enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials including horsetail waste, yellow gentian waste, corn stover, cotton material and corona pre-treated cotton material. The maximum yield of reducing sugars was obtained on horsetail waste and corona pre-treated cotton material. Waste brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was successfully used for the production of bioethanol using horsetail waste hydrolysate and corona pre-treated cotton material hydrolysate. Conclusion: The obtained results showed that bacterial strain CKS7 has a significant, still unexplored enzymatic potential that could be used to achieve a cleaner, environmental friendly and economically acceptable biofuel production.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel that has numerous benefits over traditional petrodiesel. The transesterification process is the most popular method for biodiesel production from various sources, categorized as first, second and third generation biodiesel depending on the source. The transesterification process is subject to a variety of factors that can be taken into account to improve biodiesel yield. One of the factors is catalyst type and concentration, which plays a significant role in the transesterification of biodiesel sources. At present, chemical and biological catalysts are being investigated and each catalyst has its advantages and disadvantages. Recently, nanocatalysts have drawn researchers’ attention to the efficient production of biodiesel. This article discusses recent work on the role of several nanocatalysts in the transesterification reaction of various sources in the development of biodiesel. A large number of literature from highly rated journals in scientific indexes is reviewed, including the most recent publications. Most of the authors reported that nanocatalysts show an important influence regarding activity and selectivity. This study highlights that in contrast to conventional catalysts, the highly variable surface area of nanostructure materials favours interaction between catalysts and substrates that efficiently boost the performance of products. Finally, this analysis provides useful information to researchers in developing and processing cost-effective biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work establishes a simple, customized, and economical laser-induced graphene (LIG) material produced using a CO2 laser. The one-step LIG bioelectrodes have been further validated for Enzymatic Biofuel Cell (EBFC) application by integrating them into a microfluidic device, fabricated by the conventional soft-lithography on Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This electrode and device manufacturing technology delivers a simple and quick fabrication method, which eliminates the necessity of any further amendment and post-processing. LIG electrodes were created at optimized CO2 laser (5.1 W power and 0.625 cm s−1 speed) irradiation which has been further modified by Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT), called C-LIG electrodes, which offers improved performance and enzyme stability. In this novel study, CNT functionalized LIG electrodes have been incorporated into a microfluidic device for biofuel cell applications. LIG and C-LIG bioelectrodes have been integrated into a microfluidic device under the laminar fluid flow regime and the electrochemical and polarization study of the platform have been carried out. This C-LIG bioelectrodes integrated microfluidic device, without any metal catalyst, generated 2.2 μW/cm2 power density with an optimized 200 μl/min flow rate which is 1.37 times higher than the LIG bioelectrodes. Such novel and simple EBFC platform is amenable to further improvement for generating even more power output by optimizing the LIG formation, alternate nano-functionalisation and mediator based electrochemical analysis. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In the search for microalgae species with potential for biodiesel production, Choricystis minor var. minor has been seen as a promising source of biomass due to its high lipid content and the satisfactory characteristics of its fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). For this reason, the objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of growth conditions and organic carbon sources on cultivation of this microalga. To do so, experimental cultivations were conducted in photoautotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic metabolisms using glucose, fructose, glycerol or sucrose – in growth conditions that use organic carbon. Thus, growth parameters of the cultures were evaluated and at the end of the cultivations, FAMEs yield and profile were determined by gas chromatography, the efficiency of carbon conversion into biomass was evaluated and a microbial analysis was conducted. Regarding growth conditions, the findings have confirmed that, regardless of the organic carbon source used, the heterotrophic and mixotrophic metabolisms can present advantages over the photoautotrophic one. In addition, biomass production was higher with the use of glucose than with other organic carbon sources, regardless of growth condition (heterotrophic or mixotrophic). Moreover, cultivations with the addition of CO2 have converted carbon into biomass less efficiently. On the other hand, photoautotrophic cultures presented the lowest bacterial load. In comparison to photoautotrophic and mixotrophic, heterotrophic cultures have led to lower FAMEs content and higher yields of unsaturated fatty acids. The most satisfactory FAMEs profile for biodiesel production was obtained with mixotrophic growth using fructose. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, cloisite 30B (CL) was converted to tosylated cloisite (TCL) as new heterofunctional support. Lipase from Candida rugosa was covalently immobilized on the TCL (TCLL) and used to produce biodiesel from waste frying oil (WFO). The effects of reaction time and temperature, the molar ratio of methanol/oil, and the water content on the biodiesel yield were also explored. The hydrolytic activity of TCLL was 1.96 ± 0.04 U mg−1, with the immobilization yield of 93.6% and expressed activity of 90.2%. The maximum yield of biodiesel (97.1 ± 1.1%) was obtained at 50 °C for 8 h with a 15:1 M ratio of methanol to WFO and water content 10 wt%. The features of produced biodiesel, such as acid value, iodine value, density, and viscosity, met the specifications in the reported standard test methods. After 24 h incubation at 80 °C, the relative yield of biodiesel for TCLL was 20.3%, while the relative yield for the free enzyme was almost zero. The relative yield of biodiesel for TCLL and free lipase was 70.6% and 33.4%, respectively, after 30 days of storage. Also, TCLL showed a relative yield of 61.3% in the biodiesel production after being used for 10 cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The major hurdles causing difficulties in mechanized transportation are the depletion of fossil fuels and the high cost of alternative plant-based substrates for producing biofuels. To solve these issues, biofuels were emerged as effective alternatives to reduce pollution caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. Among biofuels, biobutanol is gaining attention as a feasible, renewable, cost-effective, alternative fuel. But the usages of conventional agricultural crops as feedstock are sensitive and controversial due to the growing concern over the availability of food worldwide. Microalgae are an excellent resource to overcome these challenges, which grows on both the sea and freshwater. Microalgae reducing their land usage with agriculture, and there is no food and fuel conflict exist. In addition, microalgae utilize inorganic carbon from the atmosphere for growth; hence they can reduce the emission levels as well as produce clean energy. Therefore, microalgae as third-generation feedstock came into practice due to their fast growth rate and higher carbohydrate content. The main focus of the present review is to discuss in detail about the major challenges faced as a feedstock, genetic engineering strategies adopted and future perspectives to improve the production of biobutanol from microalgae. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The performance of biochar mediated anaerobic co-digestion (co-AD) of corn stover (CS) and chicken manure (CM) using continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was studied. Results showed that urea pretreated CS (UPCS) and biochar addition in anaerobic digestion (AD) system can improve co-AD. The effect of urea pretreatment is similar to that of biochar addition, and their synergistic effect was apparent under medium and high OLR conditions. When the OLR was 4.2 and 6.3 g VS/L/d, the biochar mediated UPCS/CM co-AD operated stably with the VMP of 2.160 and 1.616 L/L/d, and VMP of the biochar mediated UPCS /CM were 32.8%–89.6% and 27.8%–96.4% higher than other reactors, respectively. The results reveal that urea pretreatment and biochar addition promoted AD process through strengthening the buffer capacity system established by ammonia nitrogen and volatile fatty acids and improving the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aquaculture plays an important role in human nutrition and economic development but is often expanded to the detriment of the natural environment. Several research projects, aimed at cultivating microalgae in aquaculture wastewaters (AWWs) to reduce organic loads and minerals, along with the production of microalgal cell mass and metabolic products, are underway. Microalgal cell mass is of high nutritional value and is regarded as a candidate to replace, partially at least, the fish meal in the fish feed. Also, microalgal cell mass is considered as a feedstock in the bio-fuel manufacture, as well as a source of high-added value metabolic products. The production of these valuable products can be combined with the reuse of AWWs in the light of environmental concerns related with the aquaculture sector. Many research papers published in the last decade demonstrate that plenty of microalgae species are able to efficiently grow in AWWs, mainly derived from fish and shrimp farms, and produce valuable metabolites reducing the AWW pollutant load. We conclude that bio-remediation of AWWs combining with the production of microalgae cell mass and specific metabolites is probably the most convenient and economical solution for AWWs management and can contribute to the sustainable growth of the aquaculture. © FEMS 2020.

AB  - Sustainable development is the common goal of the current concepts of bioeconomy and circular economy. In this sense, the biorefineries platforms are a strategic factor to increase the bioeconomy in the economic balance. The incorporation of renewable sources to produce fuels, chemicals, and energy, includes sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), and creating more manufacturing jobs fostering the advancement of regional and social systems by implementing the comprehensive use of available biomass, due to its low costs and high availability. This paper describes the emerging biorefinery strategies to produce fuels (bio-ethanol and γ-valerolactone) and energy (pellets and steam), compared with the currently established biorefineries designed for fuels, pellets, and steam. The focus is on the state of the art of biofuels and energy production and environmental factors, as well as a discussion about the main conversion technologies, production strategies, and barriers. Through the implementation of biorefineries platforms and the evaluation of low environmental impact technologies and processes, new sustainable production strategies for biofuels and energy can be established, making these biobased industries into more competitive alternatives, and improving the economy of the current value chains. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Development of reliable Enzymatic Biofuel Cells (EBFC)-based self-powered glucose biosensor for continuous, noninvasive monitoring without restriction on patient's movement is highly recommendable. However, its application to a large extent is limited by the relatively poor stability. Herein, we synthesized a highly flexible electrode for effective enzyme immobilization by encapsulating enzyme into the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and robustly anchored to the cellulose acetate (CA) nanofiber membrane. As is well-known, such nanostructured fiber materials are the first time to be synthesized for glucose biosensor, which encapsulated biomolecules in MOFs platform during the MOFs in-situ growth on the nanofiber membranes. The as-proposed biosensor demonstrated excellent stability over 15 h of continuous long-term monitoring. The remarkable stability of assembled self-powered glucose biosensor in this work could inspire the application of enzymatic biosensors in biometrics, chronic disease management and clinical diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conventional wastewater (WW) treatment uses activated sludge process, which is accepted worldwide. However, the sustainability of such a process is questioned in terms of emissions, energy savings, and economic benefits. Microalgae based WW treatment has been proposed as a viable alternative to conventional WW treatment. In microalgae treatment, WW including organics and nutrients gets converted to algae, while reclaimed water is discharged back to the environment. Microalgae could be used as a precursor for biochemicals, biofuels or other bio-based products. There are different technologies within microalgae-based WW treatment including adsorption, accumulation, and immobilization of algae. This review attempts to understand the mechanisms of these technologies on how nutrients and organics are removed from WW. Though it is a viable alternative, there are several challenges and limitation that exist in this technology which needs to be addressed to have a commercial perspective. Algae based WW treatment is analysed for its limitation and has been reported here. Beyond WW treatment, this method should also be looked as an emission reduction strategy through CO2 fixation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, potato peels were subjected to anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce biogas (methane [CH4] and carbon dioxide), which was subsequently used as a substrate for methanol production by methanotrophs. AD resulted in high yields of up to 170 L CH4/kg total solids (TS) from 250 mL substrate (2% TS, w/v). Under optimized conditions, maximum methanol production of 4.97 and 3.36 mmol/L from raw biogas was observed in Methylocella tundrae and Methyloferula stellata, respectively. Immobilization of methanotrophs on banana leaves showed loading of up to 156 mg dry cell mass/g support. M. tundrae immobilized on banana leaves retained 31.6-fold higher methanol production stability, compared to non-immobilized cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on immobilization of methanotrophs on banana leaves for producing methanol from potato peels AD-derived biogas. Such integrative approaches may be improved through process up-scaling to achieve sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over the years, there has been a substantial increase in the demands of a portable, green source of energy for powering microelectronics to be used as sensors, medical implants and other lab-on-chip devices. Microfluidic microbial fuel cells have been identified as a genuine option to address these requirements. These cells operating at microscale level are characterised by laminar flow of fuel and oxidant which eradicates the requirement of a membrane ensuring higher performance and improved reaction rates than conventional fuel cells. Owing to these advantages, microsized microbial fuel cells have been extensively used to design micro power sources for environmental biosensors, point-of-care diagnostics, medical implants. However, the microfluidic microbial fuel cell technology suffers from some noteworthy disadvantages which need to be addressed before the commercialization of technology. The review comprehensively discusses the development, and advancements in microfluidic microbial fuel cell technology followed by their current applications, challenges, the possible solutions and future prospects. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Increased population and industrialization generate a large number of organic pollutants that create problems on the planet earth. The level of freshwater is reducing which has pushed the society to reuse/recycle wastewater. Eco-friendly and economically sound treatment of industrial wastewater has attracted global attention and hence is a thrust area of research. Organic compounds rich wastewater can be used to generate bioenergy and value-added products from the resource recovery point of view. Wastewater treatment(s) can be used to trap energy from industrial effluents in form of biofuel, bioenergy and biogas. Recovered products can be used in various ways such as recovered nutrients for (bio)fertilizer production and algal biomass for bioplastic production. Microbial electrochemical technology is a promising approach for resource recovery. This review article aims to present and discuss trends and scientific developments about recovery of value-added products from dye industry effluent. It also provides state-of-art technical information about technologies for remediation of pollutants from dye industry effluent with emphasis on nanotechnological approaches and microbial electrochemical technologies (METs). It narrates literature on classification and properties of dyes, effects of dye pollutants on environment and human health and factors affecting degradation of dyes. Generation of bioenergy and recovery of valuables from dye industrial wastewater along with challenges and perspectives of this research area have been covered. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Macroalgae are considered to be one of the rich lignocellulosic biomass materials. Aquatic biomass has gained more attention to biofuels generation in recent years due to its renewable, abundant, and environmentally friendly aspects. Macroalgae are photosynthetic organisms that are found in both marine and freshwater environments. These are considered as a third-generation feedstock for the production of biofuels since they have the ability to synthesize a high amount of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. This research study aimed to evaluate the potential of bioethanol production from macroalgae (Rhizoclonium sp.) biomass. The fermentation process was applied in the research by two-way separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF). Algae biomass undergoes a pretreatment process to release necessary sugars for yeast digestion. The fermentation process was carried at 30 to 35 °C in the incubator. Finally, the percentage of ethanol was estimated by the ebulliometer. Fermentation was enhanced by immobilization of yeast, which showed the highest concentration of ethanol (65.43 ± 18.13 g/l) after 96 h of fermentation and can be reused for several times for fermentation. Moreover, these study results confirmed that freshwater macroalgae biomass is a suitable and susceptible raw material for bioethanol production. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work analyses the performance and emission characteristics of biofuelled compression ignition (C.I) engine with the implementation of an antioxidant. Using the transesterification process with sodium hydroxide as a catalyst, the beef tallow methyl ester (BTME) was obtained from the beef tallow oil. Poor physical properties of biodiesel (beef tallow oil (BTO)) namely high viscosity and density cause atomization problems leading to higher smoke, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The purpose of this work is to enhance the performance aspects, to limit smoke emissions from BTO operation and to examine the possibility of direct use of neat BTO in CI engine. This research paves a way of investing the impact of binary blends of BHA and BTO on the research engine. The experiments were conducted on a single-cylinder four-stroke C.I engine using the following fuel compositions: 20% of BTME mixed with 80% diesel (B20), 1000 ppm mono-phenolic antioxidant (butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)) mixed with the blends of B20 (B20 + BHA), and 100% diesel. Based on the experimental results, it was found that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increases by 1.8% and the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreases by 2.5% for the fuel blend B20 + BHA when compared with that for B20 fuel blend. Compared with the B20 blend, the blend B20 + BHA emits 12.2% lesser nitrogen oxide due to breaking chain reactions, scavenging the initiating radicals and reducing the concentration of reactive radicals. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An ever increasing demand for animal protein products has posed serious challenges for managing the increasing quantities of livestock manure. The choice of treatment technologies is still a complicated task and considerable debates over this issue still continue. To build a clearer picture of manure treatment framework, this study was conducted to review the most frequently employed manure management technologies from their state of the art, challenges, sustainability, environmental regulations and incentives, and improvement strategies perspectives. The results showed that most treatment technologies have focused on the solid fraction of manure while the liquid fraction still remains a potential environmental threat. Compared to other waste to energy solutions, anaerobic digestion is the most mature technology to upgrade manure's organic matter into renewable energy, however the problems associated with high investment costs, operating parameters, manure collection, and digestate management have hindered its developments in rural areas in developing countries. Bio-oil production through hydrothermal liquification is also a promising solution, as it can directly convert the wet manure into biofuel. However, lipid-poor nature of manure, operational difficulties, and the need for downstream process to remove nitrogenous compounds from the final product necessitate further research. Livestock manure management (both solid and liquid fractions) under biorefinery approach seems an inevitable solution for future sustainable development to meet circular bioeconomy requirements. Much research is still required to establish a systematic framework based on regional requirements to develop an integrated manure nutrient recycling and manure management planning with minimum environmental risks and maximum profit. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass has attracted great interest in recent years for energy production due to its renewability and carbon–neutral nature. There are various ways to convert lignocellulose to gaseous, liquid and solid fuels via thermochemical, chemical or biological approaches. Typical biomass derived fuels include syngas, bio-gas, bio-oil, bioethanol and biochar, all of which could be used as fuels for furnace, engine, turbine or fuel cells. Direct biomass fuel cells mediated by various electron carriers provide a new direction of lignocellulose conversion. Various metal and non-metal based carriers have been screened for mediating the electron transfer from biomass to oxygen thus generating electricity. The power density of direct biomass fuel cells can be over 100 mW cm−2, which shows promise for practical applications. Lignocellulose and its isolated components, primarily cellulose and lignin, have also been paid considerable attention as sustainable carbonaceous materials for preparation of electrodes for supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries. In this paper, we have provided a state-of-the-art review on the research progress of lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock and materials for power generation and energy storage focusing on the chemistry aspects of the processes. It was recommended that process integration should be performed to reduce the cost for thermochemical and biological conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels, while efforts should be made to increase efficiency and improve the properties for biomass fuelled fuel cells and biomass derived electrodes for energy storage. © 2020 Science Press

AB  - Thermochemical routes namely pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, torrefaction and hydrothermal liquefaction yields biochar product, which mainly contains carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Biochar produced can be activated to employ as a potential catalyst in various energy production applications like transesterification and fermentation. In this regard, this article has comprehensively reviewed the biochar based catalyst for fuel production. Initially, biochar produced from various thermochemical routes and its yield was presented. Composition of biochar produced from sundry feedstock was reviewed and the reason for choosing biochar catalyst for fuel production was discussed. Eventually, mechanism by which the biochar catalyst facilitates the fuel production was given for better understanding. Transesterification and esterification reaction for biodiesel, biomass hydrolysis process and biohydrogen production facilitated by biochar catalyst were extensively discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as important collection points and environmental sources for now omnipresent waste in waterways, the contribution of landfills of microplastics (MPs) to environmental pollution has been overlooked. Due to high complexity and large quantity of contaminants in WWTPs and landfills, MPs discharged from these sites may pose greater risks to human and animal health through adsorbed small molecules or microbial biofilms. This review provides a comprehensive summary of current knowledge about the composition and life cycle of MPs in both WWTPs and landfills. We also discuss technologies that could be implemented in WWTPs or landfill leachate treatment facilities to capture MPs and potentially upcycle the polymers to value-added products. Likewise, we examine the challenges of implementing the different technologies given current practices and infrastructure. Finally, we highlight the areas where additional investigation is needed to devise comprehensive strategies for ameliorating the ubiquitous issue of plastic wastes in waterways: (1) the fragmentation process of plastic debris in landfills and occurrence of MPs in leachate; (2) the relationship among complex chemicals, biofilms and MPs, and their effects on wastewater treatment facilities’ performance; (3) the development of hybrid processes that leverage current wastewater treatment infrastructure for effective degrading or upcycling MPs and/or nanoplastics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.
